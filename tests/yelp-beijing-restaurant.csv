"Best restaurant I have been at for a while. The staff is really nice and friendly and the food, just great. I ordered Beef and Broccoli and have nothing else to say but perfect, it was exactly what I expected it to be after all the recommendations I got. I will defiantly come back...."
"If it's good enough for Yao Ming, it's good enough for me!  ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) Divey outside, pretty clean and modern for a Chinese dive inside. I like how they have pics of neighborhood peeps dining here on their walls. Came here for lunch with some coworkers. ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) Since I'm no Chinese food expert, ordered Beijing Resto's signature dishes according to Yelp friends Lolia S, Wilhelm Y, and Ken K #89 ($8) BEEF STEW NOODLE SOUP --  My favorite. A little different since I'm used to the Taiwanese beef noodle soup but the noodles were delicious with nice elasticity. Great flavor on the broth, not as deep as I've had but the super tender beef stew pieces make the dish. I want a whole bowl to myself. Order this! ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) #31 ($10) CUMIN LAMB -- Dry fried style, great cumin spice, tender. Perfect with rice. Order this!  ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) #55 ($8) BEEF PANCAKE - Mexican folks speakin' Chinese! Tasted like a Chinese ground beef quesadilla. It went ok with the table chili sauce, it would be better with guac, sour cream, and Cholula! Try it, you might like it.   ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) #46 ($10) HOT BRAISED BEEF TENDON - w/bok choy. Sticky, tender, but chewy. Could have been stewed more. Great flavors though. You can skip. ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) Another popular item here is the $5.50 lunch special, you get a soup and one of those typical Chinese-American rice plates. It was very popular with the Non-Chinese crowd and I'm sure it's OK. Do yourself a favor, skip it and order what they're known for, Beijing specialty dishes."
"As a fan of vegetable mushu / moo shu / moo shi / mu xu, I can only speak for this one dish.  The vegetable mushu at Beijing was full of flavor, not too salty and did not cause a stomach ache.  The sauce was also thick enough to stay in the pancake without being gelatinous. Why I stick with the mushu, I don't know.  Perhaps it's the DIY roll-up or the ritual of asking for ""more pancakes please"" when I really should should ask for a to-go box.  I never leave with a to-go box, just the gentle regret of eating too much of a dish that is usually good, occasionally bland, and sometimes ventures into greatness."
"4 solid stars for this spot If Yao Ming eats here you know they got to be doing something right. I have past this place more then a few hundred times, glad I stopped by for a taste.. Food wise don't go for a lunch plate try there special plates here are some of the things we tried beef tendon with baby bak choy in what tasted like oyster sauce but it was not oyster sauce. If you don't like tendon dont order this plate, it is chewy, it is sticky, for me it was deliciously awesome we tried spicy lamb which tasted as if it was marinated overnight with some heat similiar to salt and pepper pork chops but taken to another level. Again this plate had heat and was seasoned you can taste through what seemed like it as deep fried we tried the beef pancake for me it tasted similar to a dumpling of meat flattened just needed a sauce maybe dipping sauce of soy sauce it was ok not my favorite last we sampled was a beef soup, thick ramen noodles with beef chunks close to the bone pieces some full pieces of tendon with lil meat holding onto it ever so lightly, the beef alone was super tender, fall apart tender, the noodles standard, the broth excellent lil spicy and mid saltiness all over the palette Big bowl of white rice to help put down all these amazing eats, I will have to come back and venture some other choices on the special menu food **** price $$ service **** ambiance *** small venue for parties of 4 perfect lil bit more then 4 folks will feel crowded, pictures of several patrons and 2-3 pics of Yao Ming that actually came by and ate there"
"Really good fennel dumplings and beef pancake.  A perfect spot to bring a group of people for lunch.  With 8 people we ordered 12-15 items and were happy, satiated and not much lighter in the pocket by the end of the meal."
"It's funny to me that every time I eat here the female server is wearing sweats. It doesn't really bother me, just slightly entertaining. This is a good, solid restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is pretty good, it's clean and the prices are reasonable. And, of course, Yao Ming is all over their walls because he visited this place at some point. So, that's a PLUS. The only thing I would not recommend is their warm pot, unless you are sick. It's a big bowl of soup for two or three people, but it lacked in flavor. And, I don't like spending nearly $10 on something with little flavor."
"Just had dinner here last night. And we have been here a few other times before. But I couldn't remember why we stopped coming, so we figure we will give it a try again. One star for the service - helpful One star for the Parking BUT, too much MSG!  And too salty!  If you are allergic to MSG, make sure you tell them not to cook it in your dish. And all of our dishes were way too salty!  I felt dehydrated even the next day morning with a huge headache ... I better drink more water now..."
"good in theory - in practice another experience. I visited the food truck at the SF food festival. First, the Chinese burger was screaming at me - I was expecting the fried bao to be sweet & soft and instead it was hard & bland. The filling was a good start but needs tweaking more heat and easier on the Chinese 5 spice and cumin. Maybe more cilantro chopped it and some pickled onions? Something acidic. The skewers would have been better if they weren't soooo overcooked. The lamb didn't taste gamey, which is good, but it was chewy and dry - same with the chicken. Overall, it was a good start but needs improvement."
"I've been eating at Beijing for over a year now and after stopping in today, thought I should write a review. The hot and sour soup is the best in the city. It's HOT and it's SOUR and it is delicious. My husband and I always try to pick a new item instead of the same things over and over. The cumin lamb is really good if you like spicy. All of the dumplings are little gems with tasty fillings. The noodles are nice and chewy but soft at the same time. The standard things are good too, such as the Kung Pao chicken and the Mongolian Beef. The service is great on the front end of ordering and receiving the food. If you need anything after that, such as water, more tea or the check you have to pretty much get up and walk up to the counter. Despite this annoyance, I still love this restaurant."
"Update. This place is good and the flavor is there. But, the price is too high. I know they need to support themselves, but its prices deviates way too much from the average Chinese restaurant. Example: A wonton noodle soup and a Cumin ""lamb"" plate (which is actually beef and I have no clue why they call it lamb) cost over $18!? Wtf. No wonder it doesnt get business huh? I woulda got that for around $11 max at the other restaurants. Not to mention that the portion is small as hell. Btw, the server is not nice. They are sarcastically rude. That's even worse than rude."
A gem in this neighborhood. You don't usually find these kinds of restaurant in this part of town.… Read more » 
The best Chinese food in San Francisco. I'm almost half way through their menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Being able to have my meals delivered is a plus. The only thing I dislike is they close at 2100.
Not greasy.  Good food.  Clean place.  Nice atmosphere. Been there only once but will definitely be back. My mom's favorite - Shrimp Cashew. My favorite - Mu Shu Shrimp..plum sauce was delish!!!
Beef and Broccoli? Crackin' Yao Ming's photo on the wall? Oh FoSho. Prominent B.O. Musk? Unfortunately.
"Ok, update. I've tried other items and I have to say, this will be my spot for Chinese food. Everything I have tried is fresh and seasoned with real seasonings (haha, no MSG... I can tell for the most part when it is used) I really enjoy their boiled beef warm pot with preserved vegetables. Ahhhhh... comfort food. So yummy. It reminds me a bit of Sinigang (a Filipino soup). I just love how the broth is soured with the preserved veggies. Also, their delivery is pretty fast. It only took about 15mins for my food to arrive- hot and steaming."
"For now, I will just give this place three stars, because all I have tried is the Mongolian beef… Read more » "
"You probably won't believe me, but I did bursted into tears when I smelled my Zha Jiang Mian, let alone when I ate it! I'm from Beijing, with a low expectation of Americanized Beijing food, this place is sooooo authentic! The sour chinese cabbage warm pot with meat ball, the fennel dumplings, string beans, yu xiang rou si (my all time favorite!!), and leek eggs pancake...OMG!! It simply blew my mind During the past weekend, I have to come here twice as I currently live in LA and there is nothing like this here..Carpe Diem when I was in SF!! Being a Chinese or not, you have to come to this restaurant. It's simply authentic and amazing!"
"We tried their lunch specials ($5.50) of hot and spicy sliced pork which was good and their egg plant which was also good.  Nothing really special about either dish as both dishes taste just like any other mandarin restaraunt food.   Portions of egg plant was generous and very sweet, which I liked.  Also ordered a cold dish of cucumbers, which was very good.  Soup was napa cabbage soup that was good and the egg roll was plain but not greasy, much better than most places that serve egg rolls.  I would come back again but not for their lunch special which was ordinary.  I want to try their other dishes which looked   The menu does look like they offer much better selection than the typical lunch specials, but was in the mood for standard dishes today.  Service was ok"
"I was skeptical at first, but now I'm a believer.  Fresh, plentiful & delishious - reasonable prices."
"Setting: Sitting in the car after work with my parents.... Parents: ""Where we eatting tonight?"" Me: ""I'm thinking.... we're running out of places to eat"" Parents: ""Yah... But I'm thinking of this one restaurant"" Me: ""I think I know what your thinking... And I hope it's the same one"" Parents: ""If it's Yao's place, then let's GOOOO!"" I immediately smirked and LOLed in my head. Yao's place. This is what we call Beijing Restaurant now... Because this is the only restaurant that we know Yao ate at, we referred this place as Yao's place. So what's on the menu today? Well... -Cumin Lamb -Fried Tofu w/ Fish -Cai Yang Bai Tsai -SECRET MENU! Now, you must be looking at this review and the last one as ""what the hell is secret menu?"" Well, this thing that we ordered wasn't on the menu. It was recommended by one of the young waiters because it was really windy and cold outside. They saw us shivering while walking inside. Revealing of House Special! ~ ULTIMATE SECRET DISH! ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) Check out the pics, you will see a Clay Pot on a stove w/ Huge Pork Bone boiled in it. It's a type of stew pork, except more like one of those Lamb Clay Pot type dishes. This was an extremely rich dish w/ lots of pork bones and meat. The broth was thick and tasted very very good. In fact, it's so good, I don't really know how to explain it. As you can see from the other pics, the special dish also had some Bai Tsai for you to boil in it (almost like a hotpot). Also came with Fun Pi (a kind of noodle like thing). Because this is a special, I wasn't sure the name of the dish. I also don't think ti's something that you can order everyday. I'm pretty sure they don't make it often because it seems like it would take forever to get the soup based so rich and tasty. But, all I can say now is that, this special dish definitely kept us warm for the rest of the night. It was very filling and definitely makes you crave for more. That's it for tonight! I will be back to Beijing Restaurant very soon! Hopefully they can suprise me with another special item. =)"
Woohoo! As good as it gets! ^Standard Yelp 5 star message. But it's not what I think! It's more like… Read more » 
"Whenever I feel homesick, I come here. Born and raised in Beijing, this place is definitely the BEST in the Bay Area, it's very authentic, not the normal Chinese restaurants you see here, which is more HongKong/Canton style food Recommend: Stired Flour Ball with Beef Stired Preserved Green with Rice Noodles Cumin Lamb will definitely go back and try more dishes, it's SOOOOOOO GOOD."
"My favorite chinese place in the USA! Thank you for your wonderful BBQ lamb kabobs, just like the street food in China.  Thank you for your friendly service, and solid menu.  Thank your for delivering to my house, even though I live in Brisbane.  And especially, thank you for your ""Beijing Style Noodles with Brown Paste"" (Zha Jiang Mein).  I never thought I would find this dish again the way I had it in Beijing, but they have it here, and it tastes the same as I remeber! Other menu highlights: Sweet and sour pork- I don't usually like this dish, but WOW! Fried Rice (any) - Super flavorful, and not too greasy Pork with sour preserved greens - think roast pork and saurcraut Stir-fried potatoes in chile- another Chinese dish I didn't think I'd find in the US. You guys are the best!  Everyone should eat here for authentic Beijing food.  Yum!"
"Where to take mom on Mother's Day when a) She wants hotpot for lunch and b) We have procrastinated to make reservations anywhere?...to Beijing Restaurant! FYI: Yes, that parking lot on the side of the building is theirs.  Despite the outside of the restaurant looking a bit sketch, how awesome is it when you see a pic of the owners with Yao Ming right next to your table?  The hotpot part of the menu needed some translation/explanation so I'll break it down based on what I learned: For each person, it is $2.50 for dipping sauce and broth Then you can request ""orders"" of meat, veggies, or noodles.  Meat is $6.50 an order and veggies/noodles/tofu=$3.50.  You can get spicy, regular, or half spicy and half regular which comes in a divided hotpot.  This is a great alternative to other shabu shabu places that require every person to order their own meat, veggies, etc and don't allow sharing.  We got tofu, spinach, noodles, lamb, and 2 orders of beef with the half-half broth.  The spicy side was for me, and warning: It is super spicy!  My face was melting off, literally!  I consumed probably 2 pitchers of water, but pain never tasted so good!  My mouth waters just thinking about the tender meat and spicy noodles and veggies. Next time I take my friend out, it is my treat so I am going to take him here!! YUM! I can't wait!  Beijing Restaurant also inspired me to perfect my own hotpot at home!"
"So I guess I didn't know what to order the last time I ordered delivery from here. I recently sat down in the restaurant as my good friend ordered the good stuff: 27. Sliced Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot - great for those that REALLY enjoy preserved veggies 39. House Special Hot Chicken Wings (ask for Irving St. style) - my friend thinks they're better than the wings at San Tung's. I think it's a matter of preference for dry-fried or saucy wings. 55. Beijing Beef Pancake The following were good, but I could live my life without: 9. Wide Rice Noodle Salad - flavors are light 31. Cumin lamb 62. Fennel dumpling - it's true, the wrapper is too thick This time, the meal didn't feel like a rock in my stomach the next morning. The meatballs, braised pork, Singapore style rice noodles, and the Beijing noodles with special sauce are a few dishes I def want to try next time. As for tonight, dinner for one, please: Preserved Vegetable Shredded Pork Noodles Soup. Hope it's good!"

"I dream about eating here often, which is painful as I no longer live in the area. My go to dishes are the two types of hot pot and the cold tripe dish that comes doused in a red oil sauce. When I didn't have a car, I once cycled here from SF braving dodgy freeway overpasses and aggro bike-hating drivers. It's worth it. Order the most ""Beijing"" oriented stuff and you're in for a treat."
"Really good.  Got the Curry Beef, Sweet and Sour Shrimp and some Cream Cheese Crab Egg rolls.  The Curry Beef was ok, but the other stuff rocked... was so good.  Not expensive either."
"Although the 40th/Irving location opened up about a month ago in Outer Sunset, we thought to come to the orig. which opened up 2 years back, in order to shop at Manila Oriental afterward. Awesome food---layering of flavors and spicy notes really very tasty. One order lamb sa guo (clear broth soup served in an open tureen, kept warm with flame below. with special pickled cabbage which rounds out the overall flavor with a smooth, slightly sour kick) One order cumin lamb--crispy sautee/wok flavor with tons of cumin and a spicy bite to it. Hong xiao niu rou mian---braised brisket in a darker broth....noodles (thick-cut) were sooo yummy Jing dong rou bing--pork-stuffed meat pie ensconced in a very skillfully crafted thin layer of dough and layered throughout (3, i think) and then pan-fried. Perfection!!! Total for meal $40. Bargain PS There is a parking lot to the place...if coming from 280, drive past it and then do a 180 in order to spot it. Place fills up quickly, although we arrived just before the throngs came for a warm, tasty lunch."
"Overall: 4.5 stars Food: 5 stars Ambiance: 3 typical Chinese decor with photos on walls Service: 5 stars, very nice and helpful You know you're in a Northerner's house when all you hear are rolling RRR's in the spoken Mandarin and you can hear playful bantering in the background. Although the decor and the physical restaurant itself is rather mundane (red lanterns and red exterior paint) and kitschy (photos of regulars, Yao Ming are taped on walls and flat panel television with Chinese pop concerts in the background), the food is 100% Beijing style. We ordered only from the ""Beijing Specialties"" section: 1. Stir-fried Liver in Spicy Garlic Sauce - the liver was tender and the sauce was pure spicy delight. The gravy would have been excellent over a plate of rice or with a steamed bun. 2. Sweet and Sour Pork Meatballs - The American sweet and sour sauce is laden with ketchup, red food coloring 5 and processed white vinegar. Authentic Chinese sweet and sour is actually a very heavy sauce, traditionally made with black vinegar that is more similar to Worcestershire and reduced with a lot of sugar to a sticky, thick-as-molasses syrup. This sauce is decadent, and drizzled over bite-sized, deep-fried pork meatballs. 3. Chive Dumplings (Jou Cai He Zi) These are like Chinese empanadas, filled with chives, eggs and garlic wrapped with a flour pastry. The pastry is then pan-fried in hot oil until the skin is bubbling and charred, and the juices from the filling run over your chin as you bite into it. 4. Sour Cabbage and Pork Belly Clay Pot (Suan Cai Bai Rou Sa Guo) This is the real deal. The cabbage is house-made and the pork is sliced so thin that it disintegrates in your mouth. The broth is rich in pork essence and they give you lots of fen pi (the slippery glass noodles) to slurp down with your soup. I took my father there to sample the food, and he was very pleased with the meal. This is a great family restaurant, with authentic Beijing-style food at a great price. Our entire meal came out to $39 and some change, and we had tons of leftovers for the next day."
"Maybe we ordered the wrong items on the menu, but really one of the worst meals I've ever eaten. The four stars on yelp are pretty generous in my opinion. Although the reviews that say the food is less greasy than most Asian restaurants are pretty accurate, so that's a plus. What I ordered: Wide rice noodle salad: I accidentally spilled it all over the floor, didn't regret it after it happened. Cumin lamb: very popular among yelpers here, but not me. Tasted unsalted, and like it was dipped in a bowl of cumin after it was cooked...more than once. Very awful. Beijing style noodles: looks tasty on pics, but completely opposite in my mouth. Kung pao chicken: very fresh tasting, and not greasy like most places. I would love to try these dishes in another place that might be able to do it right, but maybe it was on just a bad night for these hard working people. If someone can sway my opinion, I'm open minded to any swaying. But until then I will never waste another $40 to get food delivered from here again."
"Got a great jianbing fix here. Not on the menu of course, but maybe it should be.  Love this place, but like the other location better (not like I care for the Sunset, but it's a bit easier for us to get to)."
"With just the two of us, it was hard to get a variety. What we ordered was just ok. I would be willing to come back with a larger group in order to dry some other Beijing dumplings and meats. But here's the low down on what we tasted: #148 Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce ($7.50) - yum! Can't go wrong with tender eggplant in lots of sauce. #55 Beijing Beef Pancake ($7.95) - a bit oily, unlike other beef pancakes, this one uses ground beef, rather than slices as I was expecting. #88 Beijing Noodles with Special Sauce ($7.95) - this was disappointing. Presentation wise, it was good. The bowl of al dente noodles was separate from the bowl of sauce and steamed bean sprouts, and cucumbers. She mixed it for us, dumping all of it in. Honestly, I didn't like the bean sauce. At least not this version. I've had other Zha Jiang Mian and Beijing style is not to my fancy. This was more fermented bean taste and savory with no sweetness. I would not get this particular dish again, though I would try other noodles here. Small parking lot available. Efficient service."
"I like this place a lot mainly for a few of their signature dishes. Here is what I recommend you must try here: 1. Fish and preserved vegetables warm pot (I believe it's #26) 2. Beef pancakes!! Yummy!! 3. Hot braised beef tendons 4. Honey shrimp and pine nuts (very similar to Honey Walnut Prawns at a Chinese restaurant, but with pine nuts....hehe) 5. Spicy hot beef tripe (appetizer) All of their dumplings are pretty good as well, but nothing too special that stood out to me. Their pan fried pork buns are supposedly really famous, but the last time we had them, it had very little meat in them and a whole lotta bread! I didn't like it much. Also, they tend to leave their doors closed and it gets quite stuffy and humid inside. Kinda gross because you see the steam on the windows and it gets fogged up and begins to drip......yuck! They really need a better ventilation system. But, I would definitely still come back here!"
"Yum. Finally I've found a good Chinese restaurant outside of the Sunset and Richmond. Everything I've tried thus far has been top-notch. The cumin lamb is punch-you-in-face flavorful, the baozi have a perfect crispy crust, and the sliced fish with preserved vegetables soup is an unexpected treat. I wasn't sure what to think of the fish and preserved vegetable soup initially, but I took you Yelpers' recommendations and was not disappointed. It's a clear fish broth with rock cod fillet pieces, wide mung bean noodles, and what can be best described as Napa cabbage sauerkraut. It's tangy and salty and all sorts of gnarly goodness. It's so hard to try new dishes here because I always want to go back to my favorites!"
"This place is so cute, and has the most authentically homemade noodles and pancakes ever. Items to order: # Green onion oil pancake (not layered, but the dough-y kind) # Vegetable stuffed pancake (with chives, eggs, and mini shrimp --beware of these, if you cannot eat seafood) # Jajjang Myun (not the soupy kind, and not overly seasoned --very nice texture to the noodles, and table-side mixing) # Pork Meatballs with iceberg head lettuce and gravy (lion head-type meatballs) # Flour balls with shredded pork (these are very very close to being homemade at someone's granny's) # Salt and pepper pork nibblets with chili (yum!) Helpful Notes: # For parties larger than 4, reservations are in order. # Expect that for dining-in, seating, food prep and consumption, and paying of check will take ~1-1.5 hours.  Everything is really, homemade. # Service is wonderful, and Mandarin, Cantonese, and English are spoken by the great hosts. # Prices are between $5-8/dish. # Cash seems to be the preferred method of payment. # This place is tiny with a smallish waiting area, but does have a convenient parking lot adjacent to the restaurant on Alemany and Ocean. # To-go orders are still tasty and prioritized."
"I am pleased to report that I have finally found my regular chinese delivery spot! After much hunting and sampling in the area, this place has by far the freshest and tastiest chinese food that delivers to 941112. I ordered delivery last night and it arrived super fast. I got pork fried rice, egg rolls, basil chicken, and hot garlic shrimp. The vegetables tasted like they had just been chopped and sauteed, not taken out of a freezer. The chicken and shrimp were very fresh as well. I was delighted to experience dishes that had bold but refreshing flavors, not too salty or greasy."
"Fairly authentic. The standout dishes here include their handmade Chive Pies and Beef Pies.  I also like the texture of their noodles - they are thick and chewy.  The beef noodle soup featured slices of very tender and flavorful roast beef; the only problem was the clear broth, which was bland and lukewarm.  Perhaps some of the other noodle dishes may leave a better impression. I also note that cash is the preferred method of payment.  The waiter informed me that there was an $18 minimum for payment by Visa, although this was not posted anywhere in the restaurant.  Note to the Beijing Restaurant owners: if you require a minimum charge for using credit cards, please post it prominently as a courtesy to your customers.  Thanks!"
"My husband discovered this place awhile ago.  he likes to try things that I would never normally order like cumin lamb, fennel dumplings, fish soup, the shredded Raw potato appetizer.  I have to admit it's all very good, even though I am way more into the Americanized dishes.  I don't really care for the fennel dumpling because it is too strong a flavor for me and he lamb can be tough..  My favorite is the flour balls. Today I got there just before 3 and the server didn't want to let me order off the lunch special.  When I pointed out the time, he asked the owner, who told him to let me.  I had kung pao shrimp.  It wasn't the best tasting that I have had, but this one has no MSG.  Also, it had loads of red peppers that were so fresh.  I wish it had onion, because I love onion, but the quality was very good. They didn't bring me an egg roll, and I was not going to complain about it, but halfway through my meal someone brought me one with an apology.  Pretty sweet of them."
Try something new.  The flour ball dishes are really tasty.  Even if they are actually just chopped… Read more » 
"My favorite place in San Francisco for authentic hand pulled noodles. The beef noodle soup is hearty, with bits of stewed beef and tendon, and the noodles are long and chewy just how I like them. It's amazing how much difference I can find between the texture of hand pulled noodles and those that come out of the bag. The ja jiao mien is also good here, and a bit less salty than the one they serve at San Tung. I like how they prepare it in front of you and toss the noodles with the vegetables and sauce, it gets me hungry just thinking about it. The steamed lamb dumplings are also scrumptious and have similar flavor to the dumpling shops I used to frequent in Hong Kong. The cumin lamb also takes me back to late nights in Shanghai with the grilled lamb sticks they serve on the street just like bacon wrapped hot dogs in the Mission. Free parking in their parking lot is a big plus so I can just eat a decent quick bowl of noodles and be back on the freeway in under 30 minutes start to finish. I noticed they have more typical San Francisco Cantonese food here as well on their menu, but why come to a restaurant called Beijing Restaurant for Cantonese food?"
"I enjoyed this restaurant, and it's right up there with Everyday Beijing. We shared: beef pancake -- crisp outer dough, little oily, with thin layers of meat house special eggplant -- nice flavor, on the sweet side, has chicken and shrimp beijing noodles with special sauce -- nice toothy noodles with little bits of salted meat, sprouts, sliced cucumber, works well if you get all the bits together in a bite need to try the other dishes here, including the pan fried dumplings, chive pancake, chicken wings, beef noodle soup, etc."
"I went to try their House Special Spicy Chicken Wings.  You get about 6-7 wings for $9.50.  Wow, not worth it.  Not even spicy.  I do like the fried onions and green onions that came with it.  Save your money and get something else.  Amazing how small this place is inside.  The parking lot was a plus, no need to look for a space.  The lunch special is $5.99 on weekdays.  It looks like the plate has more white rice than entree."
"DO NOT order the Hot & Sour soup!  I went to this restaurant with a huge craving for the sour/spicy goodness and instead got an off smelling glop of dark brown-near black liquid mess.  I could not believe it! That is what they call hot & sour soup??? How could they let this dish pass the kitchen?  I was so offended that they even served it to us this way.  This is literally one of my favorite soups and have ordered and made it many, many times.  I'm not usually a picky eater AND don't usually give bad reviews, but COME ON!!!   This was soup was pretty foul. For a second, I thought: maybe it's just me and the H&S soup in Beijing is supposed to be this dark, so I hopped on my phone to google it. WRONG!!! SO SOOO WRONG!!! I came to the conclusion that they had this soup sitting out, it got a little suspect so they tried to cover it up by adding extra soy sauce. I'm still bothered by it.  That soup wins an award for the WORST soup I have EVER had. I am writing this to call out the staff at Beijing Restaurant, to let your customers know if you don't have a dish available or made fresh tell your customer,  ""sorry we are out, "" instead of serve someone that crap.  Or even take it off the menu if you can't get it right.  I can't imagine anyone enjoying it.  I wish I had a picture of it to post along with this review. Despite the 1-star, horrible experience we had with the soup.  The salt & pepper pork was pretty good and redeemed itself enough for another star."
"Me: ""Been to any good restaurants lately?"" J: ""Have you tried Beijing Restaurant on Alemany and Ocean?"" Me: ""Err, Chinese food in The Mission?"" *scratches head* J: ""But, Yao Ming eats there!"" Me: ""SOLD!"" When I went to see my friend and hairdresser, he told me about this gem in The Mission. At first, I was iffy b/c who eats Chinese food in The Mission?!?!  But, if it's good enough for Yao Ming, it's good enough for me! My friend and I came here for dinner on Sunday, August 29th at 5:15ish. As you can tell, I'm a bit behind on my reviews. :X Beijing is quite small with several tables to accommodate a party of four, and then a large rectangular table in the back to accommodate 16. Since we came early enough, we were promptly seated. FOOD: BR serves up Northern Chinese Cuisine meaning you will find dishes with Szechuan and Shanghai influences that many other Chinese restaurants in the city won't have. If you're on a diet, make sure to ask how the dishes are cooked b/c some of the dishes are fried when I thought it would be braised or steamed. *Sizzling Seafood Rice Soup ($5.95): YUM! The soup was very comforting; the broth was rich and flavorful as opposed to being salty. The scallops, calamari, and shrimp were fresh, sweet, and tender. The sizzling rice is like rice crispies that are placed on the soup upon serving which give it a nice texture contrast. *Cumin Lamb ($9.95): VERY GOOD! The lamb was stir fried to a perfect tenderness and wasn't too gamey. The cumin flavor was very prominent which was slightly bitter and nutty, while the peppercorns added a strong kick. *Ground Bean Sheet w/ Pork ($7.95):YUM! This is basically a rendition of chow fun (wet). The bean sheets are like clear chow fun noodles which were tender w/ a bite. The pork was tender and flavorful and the bean sprouts added a nice fresh crisp to the dish. *House Special Steamed Meatball ($9.95): GOOD! These meatballs are basically lion head meatballs which is a hearty comfort food for me. The fist-sized meatballs were soft, tender, full of flavor; salty, savory, and sweet from the white/black pepper, soy, ginger, and scallions. *Egg Surface Tofu ($8.95): OK. I thought the tofu would be steamed or braised since it would be topped w/ an egg white sauce. However, it was fried. Aside from the misunderstanding, the tofu was soft, tender and the runny egg white sauce added creaminess to the tofu. SERVICE: Efficient and prompt, however, there was a slight language barrier. My friend can't eat fish and the Sizzling Rice Soup came w/ fish, so it took some explaining and hand gestures to the waiters. Overall Beijing is the real deal when it comes to Northern Chinese Cuisine. All the dishes are authentically cooked and as opposed to using salt or MSG, they utilize spices to produce flavorful dishes that will tingle your taste buds!"
"Beijing restaraunt comes through again!  Food was delivered warm and they came right when they said they would. This time around my family ordered Beef Asparagus: DELICIOUS, Cumin Lamb:  always a lovely treat, Singapore style Chicken Noodles: My favorite, Shrimp Wonton Soup: Yummy and Chicken Curry:  Also a delight. And even though my brothers dog jumped on the delivery guy, the delivery guy left with a smile."

"This place was gross. I went because according to yelp, this place is poppin. WRONG. We had fried prawn that wasn't de-vained, and one of the prawns must have eaten a big lunch before being caught because there was a ton of poop (yes POOP) down its back. The rest of the food was way to salty and overall not good. So, it's safe to say I won't be coming back."
"Great place to eat.  No MSG, which is a big plus for me.  When we sat down, we saw the picture of YaoMing having been there in the restaurant.  Well, if he was there, it must be good.  This turned out to be true.  We finished all the dishes that we ordered and went home satisfied."
"So I've returned back to Beijing restaurant twice since my last review and I've consulted Yelpers as to what they liked and suggested. I followed what they suggested.  Some were hits and others were misses. Cumin Lamb - spicy; remember I'm a spice wimp but good flavor to it Sliced Fish with Preserved Vegetables - my grandma commented that it tasted like sinigang, a Filipino broth with vegetables which is quite tangy; great flavor Onion Pancakes - very good but $7.95 seemed a bit high to charge for it Pork with Nappa Cabbage Dumplings - 12 comes on a dish; meh - didn't care for it Vegetables with House Sauce - nothing to rave about; you're usual eggplant, tomatoes, string beans, and sweet potatoes (?) Seafood Tofu Soup - Enjoyed this dish; plenty of shrimp, tofu, scallops, squid included Still looking for the right dishes but overall, they provide good food at reasonable prices with good service."

"Totally Yummy, eating it right now found it on yelp since I'm staying at the Alpine Inn in Daly City and this place had a good amount of stars. I have to say it was unexpectedly good! So good in fact that I would want to eat here again and again! we ordered the Combination Fried rice Salty pepper Pork Chops Shrimp with Walnut...except their shrimp is with pine nuts The pork chops are more like pork strips but either way it was tasty! I don't know if they really close at 9 or not but the delivery man said that they were really really busy. Happy Eatings! =]"
"Happy to find this place. thanks, yelpers. slowly working our way through the menu, mostly via delivery, and like many have said, we're finding the beijing menu items to be the standouts.  but even the ""americanized"" dishes are pretty decent. so far: cumin lamb:  i like the dry spice, versus a sauce. not the biggest portion in the world, but unique and really tasty, i thought. the beijing meat pancake: awesome. beijing noodles are clearly homemade and also delish, both the noodles with special sauce, and the beef stew noodles were fantastic. chow mein noodles are decent, but not as good as the beijing noodles dishes. chicken wings rock. green onion beef and lemon chicken were both decent. tried to get the special steamed meatballs tonight, but they were out. looking forward to trying those, and also dining in for hotpot sometime."
"So, apparently Yao Ming eats here when he's in SF... My friend and I came here Sunday around 5:15pm.  She found it on Yelp and we both wanted to try Beijing since it's rated 4 stars and located close by. FOOD: *Sizzling Rice Soup ($5.95 small) - Good.  Beware if you have seafood allergies - fish, imitation crab, squid, clams and shrimp are included in the broth.  I'm allergic to fish and they were extremely nice to redo the soup for me without fish in the broth since I didn't know fish would be in the soup. *Cumin Lamb ($9.95) - YUM!  Thin slices of lamb are cooked with a variety of spices, bell peppers, and onions.  Be careful, the spices add a good kick to the dish. *House Special Steam Meat Ball ($9.95, 4 pieces) - It was okay.  We figured this was similar to lionhead meatballs, which it sort of is.  Medium size pan fried meatballs are served on lettuce leaves with a thick sauce and green onions on top. *Egg Surface Tofu ($8.95) - Good.  We didn't know what the dish was and asked the waiter who told us an egg sauce was placed on top of the tofu.  When the dish came out, it was deep fried tofu pieces with a thick light brown sauce.  Although I don't know where the egg was in this dish, it was still good where the tofu was perfectly deep fried and the sauce gave it a bit more flavor. *Pork with Ground Bean Sheet ($7.95) - YUMMY!!  This dish was similar to a chow fun dish with the sauce.  Ground bean sheets were like clear chow fun/ho fun noodles or thick clear flat noodles.  The dish contains lots of chopped garlic with shreds of pork in a very flavorful brown sauce. SERVICE: Good - the waiters were all friendly and accommodating.  They were also willing to pack our leftovers (always a big plus to me!!). OTHER NOTES: *The menu states no MSG *The restaurant is clean (big bonus points for an Asian restaurant!) *The restaurant is small - it can probably accommodate about 30 people or so PARKING: A small lot is adjacent to Beijing on Alemany Blvd or metered street parking. Beijing has great food and I'll definitely be back to try more items off their extensive menu!"
"HUMAN!!!!! They serve human, here? 'No, that's Hunan',  I told my friend. Friend: Man, I thought I was gonna be Hannibal Lector on this b*tch. I reply: So do you think Yao Ming eats human? He ate here too, you know! Friend: Yao Ming eats human?!? I put my hand over my face, and shake my head side to side in disappointment. IDIOT. Beijing Restaurant should be Shanghai Restaurant cause most of the food are from there. What makes this place, different from the rest is that it's serves Northern Chinese as well as Chinese America. The parking is free and easy. It's kinda small, but it's not that hard to find a place outside of that. They do delivery, but it's free only if you reach the $15 minimum for the meals. They do deliver during lunch, too!!!! It has one unisex bathrooms and the walls are decors with photos!!!! Looks something like a Chinese Memento. It's kinda odd and funny that they chose a Ransom Note Font as their greeting/logo!!! Reservations are accepted for 6 parties or more. Credit cards are accepted here! Now to the food: Appetizers, (3.95 to  6.95) you have to try the Pot Stickers for 4.95. It's the best. Soups: (large 6.95 to 7.95) (small: 4.95 to 5.95): get the Won Ton Soup as most resturant will serve you Hot and Sour. The Warm Pots (9.50 to 10.95) are soups as well, not solid dishes. The Beijing Specials: (6.95 to 12.95) are great!!! The main dish I would choice in my opinion would be the Cumin Lamb (beef) 9.95. It's kinda gamy, but it's great!!! Beijing Dim Sum (6.95 to 7.95) are another popular dish, the pancakes are great with rice. Flour Balls (7.95 to 8.25) are a Chinese Street Food that are great in the mouth. Fried Rice (5.95 to 6.95) Steam Rice is 1.00 here. Chow Mein (5.95 to 6.95) great dish with great food. The Chicken, Beef and Chicken meals (7.95 to 10.95) are the same as any other Chinese place. Mushu (7.25 to 8.95) are good, all of them cone with 4 pancakes. (note: Chinese pancakes are not the same as American Breakfast pancakes!!!! Lumberjacks beware.) For the Veggie Heads: Tou Fu and Beggie Meals (6.95 to 8.95). There is a great lunch special that only runs in the week days (5.50). You get served with Appetizer, Soup and Rice. The staff are very friendly and the vibe is great. There is a number of Asians that go here in a common basics. Overall: Great food, great place. If you don't believe me, trust Yao Ming or he'll dunked your *ss in the hoop!!!"
"Beijing cuisine, yeah there was some, but a lot of what was on the menu was Americanized Chinese. The only reason I chose this place was because it had green onion pancake. It wasn't so much a pancake as it was pan-fried bread since it was thick and had the leavening texture of bread. Perhaps that's how it is? I don't know. I will come back for the green onion bread, but the search for green onion pancake continues. As for the others... The portions of food was very small in comparison to many other places for about the same price, so we did feel cheated. Some foods were heavy on the salt. The jiagyanmein was one of the worst I've had. The black bean sauce tasted like it came straight out of the jar and little was done to modify it."
I've eaten here a few times and it's always been very good!  The service is actually pretty good and there's even a parking lot.  The location seems to be in the middle no where. I can recommend the following: -beef pancakes (super greasy but oh so good) -spicy beef noodle soup (the hand pulled noodles have just the right amount of softness and chewiness) -garlic spinach (really garlicy...love it!) -cumin lamb (the spices are something I'm not used to but very delicious if you like lamb) Enjoy!
"Went to Beijing Restaurant in SF, 1801 Alemany Blvd @ Ocean, SF for the first time Sat 7/10/10.  They have a small parking in the back of the restaurant enough for about 10 cars, side street has metered parking.  We got there about 5:15pm and I was pretty hungry. There was 1 other table in there.  It's a small restaurant about 20 tables. They have walls w/ photos of their customers.  Chinese basketball player Yao Ming is in many photos.  That's cool. We got 5 dishes + 1 bowl of rice: Shredded potatoes w/ hot oil $5.95 - it's nicely shredded, not spicy to me.  I liked it ok. Cumin lamb $8.95 - not a lot of lamb, lots of spices, not very spicy at all. Sauteed string beans $6.95 - I thought they were ok. Onion pancake $6.95 - nice, round pancake cut into 8 slices, served temperature hot.  Good amount of green onions inside.  Not too greasy which was good.  Recommended. Nappa (sic) w/ pork dumpling $7.5 - comes w/ a small pot of soy sauce/vinegar.  12 dumplings.  I liked them fine. 1 small bowl of rice $1 - fine. Our total before tip $41.95.  They take credit cards.  One unisex bathroom in the back on the Right."
"This restaurant is only a few blocks from where I live, but I haven't given it a try until a few months ago. Because of the location and its appearance, I assumed it was an Americanized Chinese, like a Panda Express. However, after the first try, I have been going back very often. The BeiJing food is very authentic. I like their meat pancake (jing dong pancake), and beef noodle soup. Tip: Part of their menu is design for its neighborhood, so some items are Americanized, such as their lunch special. They need the customer base from the people work and live near by, which are mostly American and Mexican. These items tend to be a little salty, not as authentic, but still good. So, when you are there, try things on the main menu, and ask for suggestions. Tip: For those who expect Cantonese food, don't go there. I think that was why someone gave one star because of ""searching for green onion pancake"" CONS: their service used to be very good, very polite and available. But the last two visits, the service is just like another Chinese restaurant. You will get service, but not as good as before. Last visits, I was there for week day lunch, but before, I was there for weekend lunch or dinner. Maybe that makes the difference."
Cumin lamb - awesome! The closest to the Dongbei version I've had in China so far! Hot spicy boiled fish - superb!! lots of fish and spicy! Sauteed string beans - good but a little greasy! Pan Fried Baozi - not as good as expected. greasy and less flavorful. Staff: Friendly and helpful! 5 stars! Overall - loved the place and will be back!
"***Birthday Post*** I can't possibly say enough about this place. It's out on Alemany basically in the middle of nowhere, all by itself, and when you walk in you're transported into someone's kitchen in the far east. We could smell the food walking up and we were not disappointed. We sat down and looked at the menu. It's like seven pages. Seven pages... I thought any place with that many different things has to screw something up, but I was wrong. We ordered Stir-fried potatoes, Wushu Pork, Lamb Dumplings, General's Chicken, Egg rolls and Mongolian Beef. Stir-Fried Potatoes: They looked like noodles. We weren't sure if they screwed up our order, but one bite into them told us they'd gotten it just right. Seriously delicious. Savory, wonderful, thin sliced, wonderfully crispy potatoes in some amazing concoction of a sauce that just melts in your mouth. Wushu Pork: Four pancakes and a pile of goodness. You make the pancakes into containers for the food and you eat it as a wrap. It is absolutely delicious, sweet, perfectly cooked and awesome. Lamb Dumplings: I have heard on Yelp that these are really good and I have to say I wasn't surprised at all. Lamb can tend to be really overpowering, so to see it as part of a dumpling is a bit scary. Not so in the case of Beijing; every bite was a fantastic reminder of how truly gifted the chef is here. You have to taste these to believe them. General's Chicken: This recipe is always butchered. It's kind of the bastard child of every terrible Chinese restaurant, and honestly I was expecting it to be decent, but it was beyond description. Seriously, I've never had a rendition of General's Chicken that tasted this good. Perfectly battered, tender chicken. I feel like every dish here is a journey. Egg rolls: Meatless, terrific little bites of tastiness. Seriously great, and the sweet and sour is nothing to be trifled with. Mongolian Beef: This is by far the best rendition I've ever had of this dish. Tender beef, wonderful vegetables, I mean honestly there aren't enough adjectives in the world to describe this restaurant. Basically, the best chinese meal I've ever had. Hands down. And by the way, all this food came out to fifty bucks. *EPIC WIN* Tl;DR: AMAZING food, cheap, kind of out of the way spot, worth the trip, best chinese meal ever."
"The Good: - wide rice noodle salad - lamb dumpling - Mu shu lamb: tasty and the sauce is better than San Tung (San Tung makes it waaayyy too wet), BUT the wraps at San Tung are better - general chicken: sauce is legit The Bad: - sliced fish with preserved vegetables in warm pot We asked what kind of fish they use in the warm pot., and the waitress said rock cod. We tasted the fish and to our dismay it was cat fish. Lying about what fish you use is not cool. Verdict: I'll be back =)"
"I was considering between a 5 and a 4, but it's difficult because even though compared to everything else I've had in the Bay Area this is a 5, I can't really give it a 5 when I compare it to some of the food I've had in NYC... so I'll settle for 4 for now, until they give me a WOW. This is the first place in SF that I have liked enough that I would go back to on a regular basis. I didn't read the reviews before I went but apparently I got exactly what I should've gotten. The food here really is very good. I had no less than 3 previous vegetarians now trying to get back onto a diet with some meat and they all loved this place. The Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot was definitely the favorite. The Cumin Lamb also was a hit as well. The skewers are awesome. On the menu it came in a set of 6 deep fried skewers... but apparently when you're ordering the skewers are roasted and you can order them by piece meal... $1/skewer. Awesome deal if you're just looking to finish off your dinner with icing on the top. Scallion pancakes were decent, the stir fried vegetables were simple but still pretty tasty. Even the fried salted pork was good, despite that none of us are really into fried food. I found that I liked the Yan-jing beer better than the Tsing Tao... and we actually got it by accident (they misunderstood us when we wanted to order a second TT). All in all, despite that I'm a food snob... do NOT just walk by this restaurant because it doesn't look like much on the exterior. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it! Also, if you order two similar things and one is better than the other, they will let you know. I like that sort of business attitude."
"I liked it, the Cumin Lamb was good! Next time I go I will try to find a dish that has sauce. Yelper beware, if you can handle HOT/SPICY, you can try the Chili Delights with House Special Sauce. If not I highly recommend you do not get this. I took 2 bites and the dish was not edible, it was just too spicy. If you do get it, good luck."
"This place is one of my new favorite spots for sure.  A bit off the beaten path, but it was worth going out of the way. I'm no expert on Northern Chinese cuisine, but I can definitely say that I really like how they do it at Beijing Restaurant. Here are the dishes that were notable: --Sliced Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot I really liked this soup.  The first taste, however, was a bit underwhelming.  After stirring well and constructing a more comprehensive taste (be sure to get some of the preserved cabbage and some fish into a single bite), I found myself devouring the rest of my serving and going in for more.  It was like fish soup with a ton of kimchi in it. I imagine that sounds pretty awful to some people, but for me it was great! --Shrimp with Pine Nuts This was surprisingly good, even though it just looked like Shrimp with mayonnaise on it, or maybe cake icing or something. --Sweet and Sour Chicken I never really like ""sweet and sour"" dishes. That being said, this was some of the best sweet and sour chicken I've had. I'm not sure what the other items were called... We had a noodle salad with HUGE noodles, nice fresh veggies, and well seasoned pork. I'll definitely try to figure out what this was and order it again. There was also a spicy beef dish that was basically a soup. It was a little greasy for some, and way too spicy for others, but it was right up my alley.  With a good amount of rice to soak up some of the liquid, it was really good and definitely sated my spice lust for the evening. I had that great steady building-up of spice as opposed to a sharp biting spice. This would be a great dish on a cold day. I swear we had one more dish, but I can't remember what it was for the life of me.  It must not have been all that remarkable. I will DEFINITELY come back."
"I've never eaten-in here, but have gotten take-out a couple times now. Food's always been great, serving sizes are good, and they seem to have some pretty good selections for veggie-only dishes too (important for the wife). The english of the people on the phone can be a bit broken though, so it can be hard to order certain items unless you know what they're called on the menu (vegetable dumplings got us no where - but they have Fennel Dumplings on the menu and it wasn't a problem to order once we got the name)."
"One star because they seem like nice people.  Otherwise, the food is not worth a drive let alone a bike ride.  We ordered take out which might be the reason because they don't have to look you in the eye when they present the food. Let me put it this way, the fried rice is more like a vegetarian steamed rice without much flavor. Literally, 2 shrimp and the rest vegetables, the frozen kind, you can tell because the carrots were perfect cubes. Next was the pork chow mein  which probably had a total of 2 ounces meat, and lots of onion.  Not much flavor either. Last, was the Mongolian beef, which should me called ketchup with onions and some beef.  There were chilies for garnish only.  My little ones could eat it without complaint.  And the sauce was the combination ketchup and soy sauce. The price was average, but the food was really bad.  We only tried because our place was closed.  We would have had twice the weight in food for 2/3 rd of the cost.  Go to the corner of Brazil and Mission on the Southeast side and you will know what I am talking about."
"YES, YES, YES! FINALLY! A Chinese restaurant near my house that I ACTUALLY LIKE! (and delivers!) I hardly ever eat Chinese food, simply because there are more crappy Chinese than good Chinese restaurants in the city. I've passed by this place many, many times over the years but never thought of actually going in...until this past Sunday. And boy, am I glad I did. We played it safe and ordered some pot stickers, crab puffs, shrimp fried rice (almost embarrassing), house eggplant special and the General chicken. EVERYTHING tasted great. And piping HOT, just the way it should be for Chinese food! And the service was excellent -kind of a rarity at a Chinese restaurant! I'm very, very happy about this place. Next time, I'll order less ""tacky"" items on the menu."
Finally found a good Northern Chinese style restaurant in SF! This place is a bit out of the way but well worth it.  They have fennel dumplings which are pretty rare find in the US. Five spice beef and onion pancakes are recommended as well.  Definitely going back!
"Not your typical Chinese place here.. Authentic Beijing style cooking. No additives crap that makes it extra salty or extra oily. This place is the real deal. A noodle connoisseur like myself, I was in pure cloud 9 when I saw the doughy noodles they used in their beef noodle soup. It was excellent, could be smoking hot when they serve it but it was GOOD... The Chinese beef pancake was subpar. The noodle is the best I had in awhile. Fair in price of ($7 - $12) entree style plates. I will be back for more. Yao MING's been here, I know so because there are a number of pictures of him and the owner at posted on the walls.... so BEIJING creditability of this place goes up =)"
"My Chinese friend suggested we go here for lunch today! Due to Chinese New Year specials. Am I glad he did! He was able to walk us through the menu and we trusted Charlie to order everything and surprise us. We were the only non-Asians in the place. So you know its going to be authentic. I couldn't tell what the names were of what we ate but I'll see if I can give you a rough run down. Cold Cut platter with a soy dipping sauce with Tripe, not a fan of Tripe but the cold cuts were great. Beijing Beef Pancake was excellent. Shredded Pork with Braised Sauce my favorite. Jiao Liu Meat Ball Beijing Style crispy exterior but soft interior, loved it. Hot and Sour Potato really surprised me, I would have never guessed it was a potato. Beef with Ground Bean Sheet excellent. What a find great place. Very small only a handful of tables. The owner and staff are great!"
"Crossing over to the Northern Chinese Cuisine, I tried this place with a friend!  I must say I was pleasantly surprised that Yao Ming must have ate here because his picture was on the wall. I tried the sour cabbage warm pot and it really hit the spot!  My friend also ordered the Mu-shu chicken and it was really good with just the right amount of veggie to meat ratio.  Try the onion pancake!  Honestly it was the best that I have eaten in the bay area!  Not too greasy but just enough crisp, flakiness to explode more flavors into your mouth. I look forward to trying other dishes!"
"Looking at these other reviews I wonder what drastically changed. We ordered take out for here trying various dishes, everything is just a yellowish blur now. The food was horrible, the noodles were soggy and had no flavor at all, and greasier than your average mechanic. The soup was obviously watered down. Some sort of fish dish was also disgusting, Covered in some sauce that looked like sweet and sour, but tasted more like thick salty spit. I'm not sure if this is what caused the runs I got after it, but I wouldn't put it past it."
Never thought I'd be able to find good hand-pulled noodles in the city since most of the chinese food here is Cantonese cuisine. But of course I found this place on Yelp and went to try it after work with one of my buddies. It has its own parking lot so you don't have to worry about looking for parking. The staff here are very friendly and nice too. Portions are huge so make sure you come hungry or with people who can eat a lot. :) Between the two of us we had beef noodles with hand-pulled noodles. The noodles were soooo good. It's not too thick and it's just the right chewiness. We couldn't finish the whole bowl but it's so good! We also had the Beijing beef pancake. It's crispy on the outside with the moist beef on the inside. Yummy! We had cumin lamb too. It's spicy lamb with lots of red peppers. Probably not for someone who can't eat spicy. There were many things on the menu that I wanted to try but since there were only two of us... that was all we could order. We also had leftovers to take home. Will be back here to try all the other things I want to eat.
"The first time we came, it was too crowded.  We decided to give it another try and was disappointed.  The food was mediocre.  We were in Beijing, China and the food tasted just like the restaurants there.  Heavy on MSG and strong soy sauce."
"I noticed there were no recent reviews, so I felt compelled to keep the energy moving. This place rocks!!  I've driven by it 100 times since I moved to the neighborhood and wanted to try it.  As luck would have it the previous yelp reviews directed me (us) here after my beloved Irving Cafe was found to be closed on Sunday - see separate yelp for Irving. I am working my way through the menu but as of yet, I just can't get past the Cumin Lamb, Flour ball, and Fennel Dumplings... YOU MUST TRY THE FENNEL DUMPLINGS!! Other awsome dishes so far were the eggplant, carrot dumplings, hot and sour soup (and I am not a big fan to begin with), onion pancake...can't remember the rest, wll amend soon. The neighborhood is not sketchy...they even have parking. So far I have eaten in, taken out and had delivery.   For take out, I received a call because I was a bit late and they did not want my food to get cold (very kind). Delivery was great, the food was the same quality and hot to boot. The people are awsome and the price is fine...there is tons of food...I made three meels out of Cumin Lamb, Flour ball (have only tried the veggie and pork/veggie combo so far) and Fennel Dumplings (to live for) Oh, sorry..Flour ball is a dish made of cubes of Chinese pasta cooked with veggies or meat (or both on request).  Tasty and filling. I am picking up an order of Fennel dumplings as a side dish tonight...love em.. You will be really glad you tried this place... Peace"
"I'm Chinese, and I spent 4 years in Beijing, my friend who came with me spent her entire life in Beijing. She loved it. So, it's good, we had a really good time, and we love the atmosphere there, that really feels like home."
"I've done a few take-outs on weekdays since I work around the corner from the place. By far, comparing this newly reowned restaurant to the previously owned China Express, Beijing Restaurant wins my votes. The food best suits my taste and appetite and definitely attracts many others to their restaurant. Since I mostly do take-outs on the weekdays, they always have their lunch special of $5.50 for a list of 20+ selections on their menu. With their lunch special, for $5.50, they give you appetizer (1 egg roll), soup, and the meal. The place may seem a bit small but sure is cozy. Employees are always friendly. This place is a plus!"
salt salt salt salt salt salt salt Can I have some more tea with my salt please? 1 star for the parking lot 1 star for the hand made noodles 1 star for having pics of people my friend recognizes on the walls
"Pavlov was right.... Whenever I drive by this little red building on the corner of Alemany, my mouth begins to water and I get a little hungry in my tummy. This place is too good to ignore. The dumplings, the egg surface tofu, and the black bean noodle are just some of the menu items that stand out (yum!). I would skip the hot and sour soup though (yuck!). By the way, the staff here is awesome. Even though I had a lot of questions, they were very helpful in suggesting the best dishes. Beijing Restaurant is definitely a local hidden gem. And yes, that is Yao Ming... And yes, I find it funny they chose the ""ransom note"" font for their logo. But either way...delicious!"
"Uh oh, San Tung better watch out. There's a serious ass kicker in town, truly from da North. Beijing Restaurant. Yes more NORTH than Shandong province. And I don't see any dumbed down Chinese or much in the way of other mixed regional Chinese on his menu either. This mofo also does not use M$G or rely on sweet and spicy fried chicken to prove his salt to the ma$$e$. Some hardcore culinary kung fuud indeed. RE$PECT SF may have the legendary Old Mandarin Islamic on Vicente, but that's a niche of Northern Islamic Chinese (no pork) and you really only should go there for the hot pots and chin dribbling greasy beef pancake. Beijing Restaurant offers something that's more down home, less flashy (similar to Everyday Beijing in San Mateo) but truly hits da $pot. Get the ""warm pots"" (sa guo), which are actually super piping hot contrary to the translation. Think of them as lesser refined Northern Chinese ""nabemono"", but will surely do wonders. The star of the warm pots is the key ingredient, sour/preserved/pickled napa cabbage (suan bai tsai). When paired with the right meats, it is an unbeatable combination that is perfect for cold weather. In NE China (dongbei), suan tsai bai rou (last 2 words = white meat = belly bacon = belly good) is probably the definitive comfort food. At Beijing Restaurant, the highly recommended item from the warm pots selection is #27 ""Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot"" or really ""Suan Tsai Yu Pien Sa Guo"" which is an easy 5 stars (provided you are not put off by sour cabbage, it is as strong as the kind at Old Islamic Mandarin). The sour cabbage has the positive effect of cutting down the fat and oils from the fatty meats (especially the belly bacon) so you don't feel so dirty, yet it nurtures and soothes (and lubes) going down, while working its way through your convoluted inner pipes. The fish used in #27 is a type of cod, and is super delicious, poached to the right texture, retaining flavor and bite. These guys have it down. In addition to the sour green goodness and scrumptious fish, the application of mung bean wide noodles (fen pi) worked out way better than their thinner bean thread vermicelli counterparts (fen si) served in other sour cabbage pots, an excellent detail. Worthy of applause. Incredible in house hand made noodles, and an extremely well executed #91 beef noodle soup (the clear broth rendition), Tsing Tang Niu Rou Mien, where they actually properly stewed slices of beef shank with the criss cross cut tendon, and not using brisket cuts like other Northern or non-Canto joints in town. Even the clear broth was great. The beef stew noodles soup did look REALLY good, although that will be on the to-try next time. Pork and cabbage dumplings.....sadly this is not their forte. The texture was good, but the content was overly marinated and seasoned, which no amount of white pepper or black vinegar could do much to help. This is where San Tung and Kingdom of Dumpling holds an edge. But in terms of noodles and ""warm pots"", this place is rockin'. There is a newer and bigger 2nd location of Beijing Restaurant on Irving / 40th Ave, where you can advance order Peking Duck. Anyone tried it yet?"
"Not easy to find a good northern Chinese food place as the landscape is dominated by Cantonese cuisine so I was glad to find this place on yelp. We ordered the beef pancakes, three flavors dumplings, sweet & sour meatballs, string beans and the cumin lamb. The pancakes were good, although a bit greasy. The flavor seemed pretty authentic too. The dumplings were above average and juicy, always a plus. Sweet & sour meatballs were a new item for me -- they were small and fried and smothered in a vinegar and sugar sauce (no ketchup, yay!). That was my least favorite item of the day, but still pretty tasty. The string beans were crispy and tender on the inside, very garlicky and good. Cumin lamb was packed with flavor and quite the punch. My boyfriend thought it was a bit dry, but the meat was very tender and I liked it. All in all, the place is definitely repeat visit worthy. The restaurant was a lot smaller than I expected and pretty packed. The wait staff is a bit disorganized at seating the guests, but it's worth the wait. Also endearing to hear a Beijing accent from the waiters and waitresses."
"Been here few times, and I especially liked their beef noodle soup, cumin lamb & Fish w/ sour veggie soup. Their beef noodle soup was my favorite. The noodles were handmade, and the broth was very rich in flavor with just the right amount of kick to it. Of course it may not compare to the ones you find in Asia, but for San Francisco, this may be the closest you can get. Unlike many other Chinese restaurants we've been to, their dishes didn't taste like it was loaded with MSG /oil. Overall, a very cozy restaurant with reasonable price, fast&friendly service, and good food. Great lunch spot!"
"This is one of my new favorite restaurants.  A nice change of pace from the usual SF/Cantonese/Szechuan style food you find everywhere, although there seems to be some of that on the menu as well (but I haven't tried it yet). Recommend the dumplings, meatballs, baozi, and the homemade noodles -- wonderful texture and flavor. So far everything has been very good to great. Service is quick and efficient, yet friendly too.  The couple that own the place are really nice, and when you ask about what is in something or how they make it, you can tell from how they answer that they take care about their food and take alot of  pride in it."
"If I'm too lazy to cook (which is nearly everyday), and I don't want to starve either myself, my fiance, or the rugrats, this is my go-to spot.  The food is cheap, it's good, and best of all in San Francisco, they have a parking lot (albeit a small one)!  I've seriously been here probably close to 30 times now, I feel like I should get some sort of mileage card from this place.  It's in the Excelsior neighborhood, and for some reason my fiance automatically thought it meant they served bad Chinese food.  Dude, just because it's not in freakin' Chinatown doesn't mean it's bad Chinese food!  Heck, even Yao Ming has been in here, and if that ain't a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is! Seriously though, I've never had a bad meal in this joint. The combination fried rice, the sweet and sour chicken, the chicken and corn soup, the sizzling rice soup, the nappa cabbage with pork dumplings, the 3-flavor house special vegetables, they're all fantabulous!  I will echo other reviewers though, and say that they could probably use a bigger space.  When the restaurant is packed, it can get pretty hot in there, and yet if it's cold outside, every time the door opens the entire restaurant feels the cold draft. But, that's a small price to pay for not having to cook at home.  And I don't do Hamburger Helper."
"Ya'll are gonna laugh when I tell you this - Y hit the nail on the head when he realized why the flavor of the cumin beef tasted so familiar - can we say Chili Cheese Fritos?  Weird, right??  I kid you not.  If you're willing to give the dish a try, please do so and let me know what you think.  Maybe I just happened to go on an off night. Anyhow, this was my first visit to Beijing Restaurant (and, yes, among all the photos of patrons plastered along the restaurant's walls, I was able to quickly spot Mr. Yao Ming himself).  Perhaps it's because I don't think I've ever really had Beijing cuisine before, but I was surprised to find myself underwhelmed about the place, especially after viewing all the other highly rated reviews. For the four of us, we ordered a special appetizer (didn't have a name), beef pancake, beef stew noodle, dumplings (half pork with string bean/half pork with carrot for a total of eight), and the cumin beef.  Out of everything, I enjoyed the appetizer the best (wide noodles mixed with bits of pork, cilantro, and finely chopped cucumber, jalapenos, red chili peppers, and egg).  The beef pancake had little flavor, I prefer Kingdom of Dumpling/King of Noodles' dumplings, I didn't care for the beef stew noodle (although the rest of my party really enjoyed it, especially the noodles), and the beef cumin was just really....odd (again, Chili Cheese Fritos). Service was friendly, but I doubt I'll be returning anytime soon.  Although is it weird that I'm kinda craving Chili Cheese Fritos now?"
"This is honestly the best Chinese food I've ever had. Such taste!! Each dish was so full of flavor, from the Hot & Sour soup through to the Fennel Dumplings. Thanks to the help of the mighty fine SF Yelpers, we tried the Cumin Lamb, which was as good as represented here. My standard test of good szechuan cooking, garlic eggplant, was stellar- a complex mix of deep flavor and textures. Even the simplest of dishes- flour balls with vegetables (reminded us of German Spaetzel) was a mouthful of flavor. Good service and parking too! Go!"
"Love love love this place! Definitely the best Beijing style chinese food in Northern California and perhaps all of CA. I will literally drive from Sacramento just to eat here, beats having to fly home to LA or Vancouver every time I have a chinese food craving. Everytime I return to the states from Beijing I get dumpling withdrawls and crave all the different types of noodle based dishes served in China. This place does it right! Yum.."
"i pass BR nearly everyday, and tell myself i need to try this place out.   one random night after christmas the fella and i were driving around aimlessly trying to figure out where to go for dinner, and BR popped into his head. we ordered: 3 flavored dumplings, fillet fish w/house sauce, and hot and sour napa cabbage.  the meal was deliciously flavored in a delicate way.  none of the flavors were overpowering, but each stood out with a great taste.  they cook their dishes beijing style, and it is not your standard chinese meal but with different flavors. i'll definitely return to try their other dishes. note: ask for no msg."
"Pretty authentic Beijing-style food.  Excellent quality.  Nice and helpful people.  Different from your usual Canto-dim sum run-of-the-mill Chinese food that everyone eats.  Oh look.  I can use a chopstick and know what a har gow is.  I'm totally ethnic.  Dude.  Get over it. If you don't like this restaurant, you are a bad person. I don't want to hang out with bad people."
"How is it that yelp reviewers know so much about Beijing cuisine?  I'm no expert on Beijing cuisine being the southern Chinese girl that I am, but everything we ordered was much closer to what we found in Beijing than the other places we've tried in the bay area.  I also probably shouldn't judge a restaurant by the people who run the place, but I give the family who owns the place bonus points for their tongue-rolling Mandarin, the same kind my mother-in-law from Beijing has to repeat so I can understand.  But I digress.... We got the cumin lamb and ja jang mian (Beijing noodle dish).  The ja jang mian is the only one I've had in the bay area that is even close to what we ate in Beijing.  Everyone else serves it like spaghetti with meat sauce and that is not how it's supposed to be served.  The lamb was also well seasoned and very tasty.  I definitely see more meals at this place in our near future to try out more of their menu.  It's not often that the husband and I come across a Chinese place worth writing about."
"Stopped in for a late lunch with a friend; I'd been wanting to try it out. We were the only diners as it was about 4:00 p.m.; the family hopped up from their meal to handle our order and all was good. My friend ordered egg rolls, which I would never order, but it was her treat.The egg rolls were bland and a bit oily. The Singapore Noodles were good with a few shrimp that some restaurants leave out; I would have liked a bit more spiced cooked into the dish. At the young waiter's suggestion, we ordered the House dumplings. Again, an o.k. dish but a lot of muffin with not much stuffin'. Finishing our meal, we paid in cash, leaving a generous tip, and asked for our food to be packed. This is when it got strange.  By now two other parties had come in to eat. With one waiter, the son it appears, is managing the front of the house and is now busy. I had to ask for the food twice, it's still not brought out but the mother brings the check back out to the table. We stand up to leave and I see our food packaged behind the register. I ask for it and am handed it and then I turn to walk out. The waiter/son, mother or father calls out to me and seem indicate that I've not paid. They're all standing together and I say that we did pay. I repeat myself and they say nothing. So I just leave.  Weird. I might go back; it was o.k. enough and I didn't try much of the menu. The end of our meal though was simply weird and negative."
"The food here was DELICIOUS! I couldn't get enough of it! Food: OMG SO YUMMY! I'm totally coming back here! *beef noodle stew: BEST NOODLES EVER!!! If  you don't like beef or stew, still order this because the noodles are AMAZING!!! *cumin lamb: I'm not a big fan of lamb but this dish was AWESOME! It's a bit spicy so might not be for everyone. *onion pancake: a bit on the disappointing side, they didn't distribute the onions evenly so some pieces were only dough, but the pieces that had onion on it were decent. I think I'm going to order the meat pancake in the future though. *fried baozi: a bit too doughy but the meat inside was pretty good. Service: Good service. Very tentative to our needs and super friendly. Price: It's pretty cheap, I don't know why this place has TWO dollar signs. The bill only came to about thirty something dollars with tax and tip. Not too bad. Ambiance: Just a typical Chinese restaurant. They have a ton of pictures of that have dined at the restaurant on their wall. One of which is YaoMing! Overall: TOTALLY COMING BACK FOR MORE FOOD!!"
"Haha, my aunt and her friends ordered the cumin lamb, fennel dumplings,the fried baozi, beef tendon with greens, and some eggplant with chicken and shrimp. I have to say it was pretty good, and the service was okay, but the only downside was that it was kind of oily. If you like spicy food you should come here."
"Yao Ming eats here when he's in town! So it must be good, right? I was a bit skeptical until I walked in and saw pictures of his visit. Nice! I've been coming here with my family since it was Nulite Kitchen back in the 80s/90s. Different owners, different menu, but it still feels like the same place. My husband and I tried a bit of everything, to figure out if it was worth a second visit. I wanted to try the cumin beef based on the reviews, but he likes to stick to the more common dishes. BOO! But I was happy to get him to eat something other than wings, cheesesteak or pizza, so I was glad to compromise. So, we tried... - Potstickers: Too much wrapper and not enough filling. Disappointment :-(   (photo: http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) - Egg rolls: These were crisp and tasty. But their sweet and sour dipping sauce was too watery and had too much vinegar in it, which ruined it a bit for me. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) - Prawns in spicy garlic sauce: Served on a bed of steamed brocolli. Unfortunately there was mostly brocolli and not many prawns, and there were too many onions slathered on top. And the sauce wasn't even spicy garlic, it was vinegary-tasting and watery, much like the sweet and sour sauce. Disappointment again. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) - Shrimp fried rice: Okay, it's getting a bit better. The carrot, green onion and peas were fresh and the egg was fluffy. Too bad they only put like 9 shrimp in it. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) - Beef chow mein: Finally, a winner! Flavorful, not overly salty, not overfried, the beef was tender, and they had the right amount of onions/green onions without overtaking the dish. Loved this. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) - Also, my water was served at room temperature with no ice in it. I feel like I'm complaining alot, but if you look at my reviews, I usually don't. So when I do, I think it's justified. Food: 3.5 stars. Hit-or-miss, but mostly miss on my visit. On a positive note, the food is much less greasy than at other Chinese restaurants. Service: 2 stars. Our server disappeared after he took our order. He also didn't pack our leftovers like other Chinese restaurants do - he just dropped off the boxes and walked off. So I packed the food myself and made a mental note: ""Service is two stars."" Value: 4 stars. Portions are much smaller than at other Chinese restaurants, but the food is also less greasy. So that's a pretty good tradeoff. Overall: 3 stars. My quest to find a great Chinese restaurant in SF continues. So far, I've come to this conclusion: Chinese restaurants tend to be hit-or-miss, meaning some dishes are great and others fall short. If I find one that's a HIT across the board, you'll be the first to know :)"
"We always pass by this place and we decided to finally try it out the other day. So, I ate lunch here with my boyfriend, and I could say that the food here is good. It was just a little bit funny that the appetizer  we ordered (fried prawns) came last, when we actually ordered it about 10 minutes before we ordered our main dishes. It was not really a big deal for us, but it was just kinda weird. =p But everything else was good. We had our fried prawns, beef curry, mongolian shrimp, and fried rice. I definitely liked the fried rice because it had more flavor compared to other Chinese fried rice that we order from other restaurants. They also have a parking space, which is a big plus. And they also do deliveries, yay..! I would go back here, but I don't really know when. I'm not sure when they would see me again, but they would definitely hear from me again, ordering food for delivery.. haha.. =)"
"The most important that needs to be said is a huge ""thank you"" for all the previous reviews for making this a great choice to bring my family. Every weekend, I take my grandma and my mom who are extremely picky old school eaters, out for lunch. One weekend, I didn't know where to go, and I just decided to stop by here since I read it up on Yelp, and since my mom loves beijing/sichuan style cooking.. it was perfect. Jing dong, hot boiled beef, cold tripe, wide rice noodle salad are simply divine. All the noodle soup dishes are amazing, and the pickled vegetable with fish filet soup is great. I don't really like the three flavor flour balls as much as most people do but this place has a lot of different great foods, and the price is very reasonable."
"Small 46-seat Northern Chinese restaurant in an only mildly ghetto neighborhood, with free parking and a cheap $5.50 Whitey rice (sweet and sour chicken etc.) lunch special as the primary draw. Quick to seat, slow to serve. At least it's clean. The tea's free, though they might as well call it hot water -- tea? I don't taste any tea... House special Beijing style noodles -- the noodles were soft and lacked any kind of expected chewiness. The miso and beef sauce was very strongly flavored. What stuck out was the large amount of celery. Locavore fail -- I'm sure it's not a regular ingredient of the original dish. Not Western friendly. Onion pancakes -- very flavorful scallions, but instead of a thick, chewy dough, this dough was like a spongy raised bread, like a very thick pita. I suspect it's similar to the recipe they use for their steamed buns. Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) -- these aren't the thin skin dumplings you're looking for. They're large, fluffy steamed buns (baozi), seven to a basket. Any tangy, savory sauce inside has been soaked up by the dough. Cumin beef -- typically lamb, but we went with the beef. I've had the dish many times, but this beef was definitely the strongest tasting. The beef was practically breaded with cumin. Do not order unless you're a huge fan of cumin -- it's the sole flavoring of the dish. Overall, it's palatable, but there are better Northern Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area."
"Even though the location of this restaurant is fairly close to my home I would have not found it so soon had it not been for Yelp.  I first tried some menu items from this restaurant back in June, and I've become a regular customer since, but only recently have I actually sat inside the restaurant to eat. The restaurant space is fairly small.  Hundreds of photographs adorn the walls and if you've read some of the other reviews you'll probably already know that basketball star Yao Ming is featured on several of them.  The service is excellent, and honestly, when was the last time you heard that about a casual, inexpensive Chinese restaurant in the City?  They have their own parking lot too, and they deliver to the neighborhood.  They even deliver for free if your food total hits the $15 minimum. I've stuck to the House Specials, the hand pulled noodles and the Beijing dim sum for the most part.  I think the only dish I've ordered not listed under those three categories was a beef chow fun, and I've had that at least three times.  Here are some of the items I've tried when I've dined at the restaurant. House Special Steamed Baozi ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) and ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) - These are little steamed buns with a lean pork and chopped Chinese greens filling.  They're not soupy like xiao lung baos, and the outer bun is quite thin.  These are quite good but only when they're hot. Three Flavor Dumplings ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) and ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) - These are my favorite steamed dumplings here.  They're packed with a juicy mixture of ground pork, ground chicken, shrimp and chopped chives. Beef Stew Noodle Soup ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) - I love their hand pulled noodles which are less doughy than some and always seems to have the exact same chewy consistency and texture.  The beef stew has a good mix of meaty pieces, pieces with tendons and tender Shanghai bok choy.  I'm not a big fan of the dark brown broth though because I think it lacks depth. Preserved Vegetable Shredded Pork Noodle Soup ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) - This is easily my favorite of the soup noodles here.  I often have the spicy preserved vegetables with pork over rice at home, so this selection is very homey to me.  The vegetables and pork are stir fried then served on top of the handmade noodles and chicken broth.  I love the little splash of sesame oil to finish the stir fry.  It just taste so good!  The broth in this dish is usually perfectly seasoned for me. Beef Chow Fun ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) - I learned about good wok hay at a very young age.  Wok hay in Cantonese often refers to foods cooked perfectly in a wok with a nice seared flavor locked into the ingredients.  The fried beef in Beijing's beef chow fun has a beautiful crust on nearly each piece of meat sizzled to near perfection.  They go really easy on the bean sprouts and the onions too meaning I get more chewy rice noodles than I do inexpensive fillers. House Special Hot Chicken Wings ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) - These crispy fried chicken wings are very good with a nice outer crust and juicy meat on the inside.  Mixed in a saute of green onion, white onion, cilantro and dry red chiles the flavor had absolutely no spicyness to it however.  Perhaps had they broken the meat of the chiles that would have helped.  If you want good chicken wings these are very good.  If you want good, spicy chicken wings then these are definitely disappointing. Overall I'd give a 4.5, but for hand-pulled noodles and flavorful dumplings delivered to my front door I've got nothing but 5 star love for Beijing Restaurant."
"Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to check it out since I've been looking for some good hand-pulled noodles.  The dining area was bright, neat and clean.  The chairs and tables are dark wood and the restaurant has a cozy feeling to it as there were tons of pictures of the owners with customers throughout the walls.  One particular customer that stood out was Yao Ming, definitely a good sign if he eats here.  ;) The service was friendly and staff extremely nice.  I ordered the Yelp recommendations but also asked the waitress/co-owner for recommendations. She said a soup or warm clay pot would complement our selections.  She recommended the Sliced Fish with preserved vegetables warm pot.  It was an excellent recommendation as it turned out to be my favorite dish here. To the food: * Sliced Fish with Preserved Vegetables Warm Pot:  This was the best dish, tasty and contained generous slices of rock cod, homemade preserved vegetables, clear noodles, and topped with fresh cilantro.  Nicely served on a stand with small sterno-type chafing fuel to keep the pot warm. ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) * Cumin Lamb:  This dish was very tasty, generous amount of cumin seeds and lamb which were stir fried with green peppers and onions.  Very flavorful and surprisingly minimal amount of oil. ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) * Beijing Beef Pancake: Was so huge it barely fit on the plate, filling tasted similar to the meat in dumplings. ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) * Beijing Noodles with special sauce: The noodles were chewy and slighlty gummy.  The sauce was salty, dark brown, and contained real pieces of pork. Served with diced celery, bean sprouts, and julienned cucumber. ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) * Mongolian Beef: This was good as well but was overshadowed by the other dishes. ( http://static.px.yelp.... ) While we were eating one of the patrons asked the waiter/co-owner what ingredients were in a dish.  He said about 14 different ingredients but he didn't know what they were. So he than called out the other waitress/co-owner and she patiently listed out all the ingredients by heart. This is the reason I gave this restaurant 5 stars, besides the great food, the owners are very nice and patiently answer all questions.  Other Chinese restaurants you usually get a quick ""I don't know"" or dirty look like you are trying to steal their ancient Chinese recipe.  Also, they have their own parking lot with 6-8 spaces and did I mention Yao Ming eats here?"
"I really liked the food here, the food deserves a 4 star rating for it's unique flavors and authentic dishes. But the inside is too small and drafty to give it 4 stars. I would give the advice that the owners expand to a larger area as it gets rally busy and crowded. But if the interior is not an issue for you I really recommend making a trip and having some of the Beijing goodness."
"Great authentic Beijng/chinese cooking. I came here for the first time for my boy's birthday. Ate many vegetable pies, spicy wide noodles, steam dumplings, and other items i can't remember (we ordered a lot!). The food is just perfectly seasoned, all handmade, just great food! So why 4 stars, well unfortunately i feel the prices are a bit on the higher side. It is the price you usually see at other places that serve the same dishes, but either way it is high in my opinion. In the end, i will return to this place, because the food is good. Service is okay, they don't come and check on you like other good customer service restaurants, but they are happy to assist you if you call them over."
"Jonesing for some Chinese food the other day, we strayed from our usual go to Chinese takeout spot- Yummy House- and opted to give Beijing Restaurant a try. We ordered the following- Large hot and sour soup Pot stickers Beef pancakes Chicken chow fun Mongolian beef Steamed rice Total was $37, but could have easily served 4 or or 5 people. Katie H. and I got three meals out of it. The large hot and sour soup was about double the quantity I was expecting. Definitely a good value. And we were pleasantly surprised by the quality. The stand-out dishes for me were pot stickers and pancakes but everything hit the spot. Definitely at least on par with Yummy House, with a much bigger menu and an actual restaurant if you feel like dining in. They also have lunch specials for $5.50 which looked pretty good. (The lunch specials at Yummy House have always been a disappointment). I definitely look forward to eating here again and exploring the rest of the menu. Welcome to the neighborhood, Beijing Restaurant! Update 12/11/09: Went back for seconds and ordered the following for delivery: Lg. Hot and Sour Soup Beijing Beef Pancake Mu Shu Chicken Beijing Noodles in Special Sauce Beef with Green Onion Napa w/ Pork Dumpling Crab Cheese Puffs Steamed Rice Total was $56 + change. Nothing particularly wowed us this time. The napa/pork dumpling is basically a pot sticker, maybe slightly smaller, but more to an order. Crab cheese puffs were pretty standard. Beef w/ green onion was basically mongolian beef without white onions. The only truly ""new"" dishes that we ordered were therefore the mu shu chicken and the beijing noodles in special sauce. The former was pretty good, although a little light on chicken and heavy on cabbage and other filler. I did not enjoy the beijing noodles- the noodles themselves were OK but the sauce was overly salty. Basically, the dish consists of thick, udon-like noodles in salty brown sauce with bean sprouts, celery and eggplant. Seemed like kind of a rip for $7.25, the most expensive noodle dish on the menu. Not nearly as good as the chow fun. Delivery was pretty prompt at prime time  on Friday night but the delivery man claimed not to have change. Not a big deal but something to keep in mind in the future. Everything was pretty good except for the beijing noodles, which I wouldn't order again. Got to try to branch out a little more next time."
"All the dishes I tried were very good. They had some weird small doughy balls that were really good with vegetables. The noodles with the black sauce was good too. Extremely good quality, but it is expensive for chinese food."
"Still really like this place.  When I'm in SF, it's a dependable lunch.  My String Beans with Chicken was a tad salty but still delicious, whereas my sister's Tofu with Mushrooms was a little bland and undercooked.  (But that sounds like it should be a bland dish, right?)  3-4 stars, I guess."
"You wonder what inspires a group of twenty-something-year olds to open a restaurant--so much work,… Read more » "
"This place still rocks! Again, the key thing is to NOT order standard sounding Cantonese or American-Chinese fare and to focus on the ""Beijing Special"", ""Beijing Dim sum"" and the ""Noodle"" sections. (See the menu photos I took that are in the photos section). Noodles are still hand pulled à là minute (or at least every day) in the kitchen. Since a lot of dishes are made to order, some dishes will come out quickly, while the other dishes will come much later, like the pancakes/pies (bing/he ze). Don't fret the wait and enjoy the freshly made stuff. Lots of other restaurants just heat up frozen (but housemade) bing/he ze in a wok of oil. I think the Yelp effect has taken over the place and now, and even on a weekday night, the wait for a table can be 20 minutes long. They also seem to do a lot takeout and delivery business too. I'm glad the owners (Sandy and Jin) are doing so well but I just wish I didn't have to wait to get seated to gorge on their food."
"My FAVORITE Beijing (Northern) style Chinese food in the Bay Area. Please, please do not order the… Read more » "
"it took me a long time to stop by here when i'm out visiting my dad, but my sister kept saying it was really good. and it is really good."
"I will definitely come back. The food was pretty good and such a good deal.  We accidentally ordered a potato salad in hot oil, which is actually uncooked potato shredded finely and soaked in hot chilli oil.  The was so good and so unexpected.  Definitely not something I would normally order. The other items we ordered were nothing special and it wasnt all that spectacular.  However, for dessert we got the sweet fried rice cake that was stuffed with red bean paste and that was totally awesome.  You get at least 16 pieces for like 5 bucks... I want to come back just for that and the potato salad. And next time I will try more beijing items."
"""Yum"" sums it up entirely! Hand pulled noodle, fresh northern style Chinese food (all doughy in a good way and delicious!), their own parking lot, free delivery - what more could you ask for?  Totally authentic northern Chinese food; noodles and all dough items had the appropriate amount of chew/bounce back and were not at all soft or mushy.  Don't be scared off by the exterior - the inside is nice and it's a great meal. The ""fried cakes"" are a mochi-like pastry filled with a red bean/date paste mixture (and deep fried) which is devine - just eat them hot or you won't be able to get past the oil! A few things to watch for: We've eaten here a couple of times now and it's delicious, but stick to eating in the restaurant...this stuff, even with free delivery, just isn't as good when you're waiting 30 minutes for it to arrive. Ordering off the menu is a little tricky - I speak Chinese and had a hard time with their dish names.  The waitresses are very nice though and would tell me what the item's Chinese name was."
"I haven't eaten here enough yet to give this place 5 stars, but noticed its original 4.5 star average was knocked down to 4.  I glanced at the reviews and some guy posted a one star review yesterday,   Have you noticed all the other glowing reviews?  That's because it's good.  So I'm giving 5 stars to offset this fucking numbskull.  Hey, I'd buy it if he said it didn't float his boat, but to call the food ""awful"" and condemn it with one star comes across as sneering narcissism. I might write more about the restaurant later, but I'd like to point out one small thing--the big fat hand made noodles are apparently only available in the special noodle section.  The chow mein is made with the regular skinny noodles you see all the time.  Still, it's top notch."
"I grew up in BJ and came to SF 1 year ago. I like the fact that there are lots of Chinese restaurants here. But 2 things keep disappointing me. One is, what I order in the restaurants are rarely what I was expecting. Most of the dishes are very different from the Chinese version, and rarely better. The other one is, sweet dishes are over-represented in the Chinese restaurants here. It's Hong Kong or Guangdong style, but not for people from other parts of the country. That's why I like this place. It has real BJ dishes. People are also very very nice here, I like the owners' BJ accent :P I always go with a group of Chinese people including several native BJers, and these are our favorites. We order them almost every time, so haven't got a chance to try other things...(!) Shredded Pork with Braised Sauce Cumin Lamb House Special Steam Meat Ball Hot Spicy Boiled Beef/Fish Stired Fried Potato with Chili Sauteed String Beans House Special Three-Flavor Vegetables"
"First experience. Cumin lamb was good, war won ton was just ok. But delivery was quick & friendly! Perhaps I should have ordered more of the Beijing specials! Will absolutely try again."
"I'm telling all my friends about it.  That one bowl of noodles just made my nervous little life worth living.  Yes, it tastes muddy and salty, but it is soooooo comforting and good. It's like when I was little and eating shrimp-paste  ""jing"" pork with my grandma and grandpa. It's like that and different. Jiang Mian.  Hey, if all the Chinese construction workers are eating it, why not...? Of course my husband, a transplant from Portland Maine, is totally terrified by the noodle dish."
"The range of Beijing items offered is narrow,but the food is authentic (if you stay away from the non-Beijing items such as sweet and sour or cantonese items).  Beijing items are grouped in two areas on the menu (Beijing Dim Sum and Beijing Specialties I believe) so they're fairly easy to identify.  The stir-fried flour (like a gnocchi but with flour instead of potato) is also a Beijing specialty. I ordered the ""vegetable pie"" (Chinese crepe or Flatbread with Chinese Chives & Eggs is a better translation).  It's really good and not greasy at all (sometimes it can be greasy if not well made).  The version they make has dried-shrimp in it, so if you don't like dried shrimp avoid this dish.  The house specialty pie is similar but with pork added. I also ordered a mixed vegetable which was very simple and light (cauliflowers, tree ears, tofu skin, gluten and celery).   The lamb with cumin was good and surprisingly light.  I liked it, but I prefer the heavier, spicier version in Sichuan restaurants more. I am looking forward to going back and trying their other flat breads/buns/dumplings which the North is known for."
"I think I'm in love!  You'd never be able to tell from the outside, but they serve straightup great food here . . . the Cumin Lamb is as advertised, an explosion of flavor - spicy and delicious and not greasy at all.  Their Mongolian Beef is more subtly flavored but also terrific.  Haven't tried many of their other dishes but I'm looking forward to many meals here so I will report back. All this, and FREE PARKING!  Go!  Now!"
"I ordered two kinds of dumplings, to be delivered to my house.  It came in 25 minutes, and was delicious.  But I docked a star because they didn't tell me they only accept cash for delivery, and I didn't have enough cash. He had to write down my credit card number, go back to the restaurant to run it, and then come back again for me to sign it."
"Wonderful. The menu's quite extensive, but we followed recommendations and tried to keep towards the Beijing dishes. The food: #26 Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot: Delicious. Normally I'm not particularly inclined towards fish soup or preserved vegetables, but I'd love to have this again, especially during cold weather. The mild white fish contrasts very well to the sharp taste of preserved vegetables, and the broth is tasty without being too heavy. The noodles were hard for me to eat, but that's my problem. #54 Beijing Beef Pancake - my favorite, 'cause how could it not be? There's a pretty thin layer of delicious beef between wonderful layers of soft, but crispy on the outside, ""pancake."" I can't offer the most accurate comparison of what other culture's bread-like, meat-stuffed thing this is, but it's pretty much perfect. #66 Stired Flour Ball with Pork - probably my least favorite, although still pretty tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect with the flour balls, but they had the texture of slightly undercooked pasta, which is not bad in and of itself, but I kind of associate it negatively with the pasta. The flavors were good though. #91 Beijing Style Noodles with Brown Paste - We asked for a recommendation between this and the Beijing Noodles with Special Sauce. We were told the ""special sauce"" one was ""dry,"" while the brown paste was wet. I was a bit wary of the special sauce after hearing it was salty, so we went with brown paste - which definitely was ""wet,"" somewhere in between a soup and heavy sauce consistency. I liked the noodles, and the sauce was tasty, but a little bland. We had tons of leftovers, and I think I'll add a lot of vegetables to absorb some of the sauce. The meal came to $33 without tip and would have very easily been enough food for 4 people. We were told the delivery radius is 2 miles. I can't wait to come back."
"Food - 4.5 stars Green Onion Pancake - lots of green onion, hot and crispy on the outside and yet, chewy inside.  One of the best we have had especially if you LOVE green onion Lamb Dumplings - you taste the lamb and know what you're eating. Juicy and soft. Beijing Style Noodles - great noodles, but would like to have more condiments - bean sprouts, cucumber and the sauce are a bit salty. Ambience - 4 stars Clean little place and imagine, has its own parking lot, Kudos for that!! Service - 4 stars Friendly and efficient! Price - 5 stars Two people stuffed with tasty food and out the door with tips @ $25!! What more can you ask for?! So... from my math, overall it's totally 5 stars and can't wait to try out the other recommendation!"
"One bite of their garlic-flavored sausage, and I'm transported back to my childhood in Beijing.  Their cooked dishes are fairly authentic, too. Must tries: 1. chive pies 2. meatballs I'm not wowed by their zhajiang mian.  Nice try, but it doesn't quite hit the right note."
"Agree with other posters about the unexpected pleasure in finding this little gem.  Love the decor of customer photographs--gives it a warm and friendly feeling.  Staff is also super friendly and helpful. We tried 3 of the dishes recommended by fellow Yelpers and were not disappointed!  All portions were larger than expected and our three dishes fed two of us for more than a day.  (-: The Beijing Noodles were beautifully presented with the sauces/condiments separate from the noodles so that they could be custom mixed by the diner or server.  The onion pancake was fresh and slightly sponge-y...again, perfectly prepared.  The Cumin Lamb was a little salty, but delicious--spices were visible on the top of the moist and thin slices."
"Fennel Dumplings was just alright for me. Hot and Sour soup is a bit sourly for my taste, but my friends LOVE it. Cumin Lamb is a MUST-have dish!!!! We will be back and try other dishes...:)"
"It's hard to find good Chinese food in the City south of the Sunset, so for that reason alone the restaurant is a diamond in the rough. The food was flavorful and authentic, avoiding a lot of Americanizations. The decor is nothing remarkable, though it is a nice touch that the walls are adorned with past smiling customers. The staff is friendly and care about you enjoying your meal. The place is a little tiny, but you'll enjoy yourself the most with a group of friends since the joy of coming here (and all good Chinese restaurants) is the variety, crispy, soft, sour, spicy, salty, sweet, fried, steamed, etc. Some practicalities:  If you come here with just another friend, take a peek at the recommendations to settle on something, otherwise, the choices can become daunting. I always like to choose one thing familiar, and one thing I've never had before. Parking is not bad and it's easy to get to by bus."
Their flour balls remind me of gnocci. Food is good. They have parking. A nice quiant chinese food joint in the Excelsior..
"My family has lived in and around this area since before I was born. I remember coming to this very location when it was HS Salt. It was a sad time when the fish and chips joint left. And we've seen so many Chinese restaurants sit in it's place. This is the first time I've seen such a highly rated place occupy this very location. All of the others seemed to be American fare Chinese food places. I was surprised when my brother showed me the to go menu the other day and said the place was actually good. He'd been trying their lunch menu and had nothing but good things to say about it. And of course he tried the 2 things I would have liked to have tried: the Mongolian Beef and the Double Mushroom Chicken. The two things he said that made me want to try this place is that they used fresh veggies. THere were NO canned straw mushrooms inthe double mushroom chicken and they make their own noodles. Okay let's give it a shot. He wanted to actually just do pick up and order in but he misplaced his to go menu so we drove over for an early Friday night dinner. He had actually driven by the night before with his friend in the hopes of having some soup but there were no parking spaces to be found within a 2 block radius and when they drove past they noticed every table occupied as well as the waiting area quite full. On our early Friday night dinner, there were 2 tables occupied and a few people waiting for pick up. Very small dining room. I was curious to see how they set up the dining room in the first place, remember this used to be HS Salt. Lol. And YES there are a plethora of random photos adorning their walls. What did we order? The beef chow fun, the general tso's chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and the Beijing beef pancake. The chow fun was great. Great flavor. Very fresh. And piping hot. The mistake we made was ordering 2 dishes that were very similar but we weren't sure how hot the GT chicken was going to be and we had my kids with us. Well both chicken dishes were very similar and really uneventful. The pancake was just okay to me, I think it needed some sort of sauce or something? Soy and vinegar? My brother and I both agreed that maybe we needed to order something else b/c this visit was just ok. I would have liked to try the other 2 dishes he tried, but he said he already had those and needed to try more on the menu especially since they're so close AND they deliver."
"This place use to be a Nulite kitchen and I never really had much from there besides the occasional Won Ton soup when I was sick, so when they opened as Beijing Restaurant I wanted to give it a try. I decided to go on Christmas Day 2 stars for being 5 blocks from my house. The other 2 stars were for the food. It wasn't THE BEST but it was good. I didn't try anything I didn't like. I will definitely be coming back for some conveinient food"
"Beijing Restaurant is a great neighborhood resource for those living in the Mission/Bernal area who don't always have time to drive to the Sunset, Richmond, or the Peninsula for authentic Chinese food. Beijing Restaurant is definitely a family run, mom and pop kind of place. I love the cumin lamb (requested extra spicy) for its tender lamb and strong cuminy spicy flavors. The house special pie is about an inch thick and stuffed full of ground meat and scallions. It's quite different than the run of the mill scallion pancake at other places, more filling too. I had heard great things about the house special eggplant and I love Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese/Chinese preparations of eggplant. That being said, it was a decent plate of eggplant but no better than other versions I have tried. The sweet brown sauce served with it was reminiscent of that served by many take-out type of places. The waitstaff were really friendly and actually seemed to care if we enjoyed our food (a rarity at some Chinese places). They were also diligent about keeping our tea and water refilled. And they deliver too! Looking forward to returning to try the warm pots with preserved vegetables, house pies, pancakes, and dumplings, and some of the other Beijing specialties."
"So I came in here with my darling dad and beloved uncle, both of whom are very picky eaters. The waitress made excellent suggestions, none of which I understood, many many plates rolled out and we ate ourselves sick and I'm stuck with at least two days worth of leftovers. Apparently there are weekend specials that are very beloved by my old school relatives."
"As I drove up to this corner restaurant, I thought, ""this can't be the place"".  I was looking at a run-down wooden building, slathered top-to-bottom in faded red paint, with a 20-foot tall, shorted out ""Chinese Food"" sign outside and wilted red lanterns hanging from the eaves.  I noted two more ""Chinese Food"" signs leaning against the outside of the building.  I might be wrong, but as I parked, I think I may have heard an argument coming from the kitchen (yes, this place has an actual parking lot!). I went in anyway. The interior was bright (almost too bright), cheery, and the walls were covered with photographs of hundreds of happy customers in various poses.  The waitress was perky, helpful, and just as friendly as can be.  And the food?  Superb.  As each dish came to the table, I struggled with the dichotomy of the impressive food quality versus the look of the building.  How can this be? The explanation came quickly: ""We've been open for six months"". This place deserves all the rave reviews it's been getting.  The prices are very fair, the cooking is superb, and the people are friendly and helpful.  And there's parking.  That's something I can't say about nearly any other Chinese restaurant in SF.  Go there soon!"
"How did I find out about this restaurant?  Pulled one of those front door delivered menus from the door knob.  There was something very different about this one... in reading the menu, there was acutally Beijing food on the menu!  Boy, was this a pleasant surprise.  So many restaurants named Mandarin, Hunan, Shanghai, or other northern cooking styles offer menus that don't reflect their cuisine, serving the more common Cantonese fare.  This restaurant is the real deal and, yes, they literally deliver too! When dining with my family, we recently ordered the following: Appetizers: a) Green Onion Pancake - Green Onions check.  Tasty dough check. b) Steamed Pork and Vegetable Dumplings - Tasty choice especially with dark vinegar dipping sauce. c) Pot Stickers - The plate came piping hot and the bottoms were crispy good. d) Rainbow Noodle Skin (Fen Pi) - A segregated salad mixture of shredded eggs, cucumber, green and red bell peppers, pork slices, and cellophane noodle in a sweet brown sauce (possibly the same bean sauce on their jia jiang mein).  It reminded me of Great China's (Berkeley) famed ""Double Skin"", but not quite as good. ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) e) Pork Meatball Soup - Served in a clay pot over a small flame, the ingredients include sour cabbage, Napa Cabbage, pork meatballs, and cilantro in a tastebud opening broth.  If you don't like sour, you won't like this dish.  ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) f) House Fried Rice - My brother chose this dish because he tired of the normally served white rice at most Chinese restaurants.  It was okay with small pieces of beef and shrimp. g) Fish Flavored Eggplant - Cooked in a brown sauce spiced up with some red chili oil, the eggplant was both soft and chewy at the same time. h) Basil Chicken - Stir fried chicken meat with baby corn, red bell peppers, water chestnuts (canned), and basil, this dish was tasty and a nice contrast to the other dinner flavors.  ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ) As usual, we overordered for a party of four.  However, since our family doesn't mind leftovers, the abundance of food is not an issue.  They also offer a hot pot menu, which is nice during winter months.  We arrived before 6 pm to beat the dinner rush as the restaurant is quite small (six or seven tables for four and two large tables for ten or more).  They have a small adjoining parking lot that is gets full later in the evening (if you don't want to wait, come early).  We must dine here more than I remember as we were seated next to our picture on their walls of fame (assorted pictures of dining guests).  The delivery option also makes things convenient if you can't let go of the TV remote control at home."
"I checked out this restaurant with a couple coworkers yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised by the service and food.  The owners have only been there for about a week.  I've lived in Beijing for a little while so i can tell you that the food here is very authentic. They have all the dishes you would find in a beijing restaurant like their cold garlic cucumbers(pai huang gua), the spicy oil fish stew(shui zhu yu), traditional style tofu dishes, cumin lamb skewers, etc. I had the kung pao chicken from their Lunch Specials menu and it filled me up.  It was a little on the salty side, so the rice was definitely welcomed.  A $5.50 lunch that comes with soup and an eggroll, it can't be beat!  I hope this place does well. I came here a second time and ordered their Soup in Clay Pot with cabbage and pork.  It had these clear flat noodles in it too so you don't need to order rice.  Huge portions at a great price!  I was stuffed for lunch...then I ordered a lamb skewer. : )"
"I chowed here with my close friend and her family.   And as we often do, we over order not knowing that they also serve huge portions.  We had the green onion pancake, steamed shanghai dumplings, lion head meatballs, dish of mixed veggies, cumin lamb, cilantro tripe with some steamed rice. As we order, we are mindful to ask the server to go light on the oil as all to often Chinese food can be quite greasy.  The food came out beautifully cooked, flavored, and not a bit greasy.  And from reading other Yelpers, apparently their standard business practice is light on oil, huge portions, and yummy. They did completely forgot our drinks and had to be reminded, that is understandable as it was a early evening and our table carried great conversation of fond Beijing visitation memories. I loved everything (food, folks, and Beijing memories) about this restaurant and will definitely go back with friends and family. This place capture the delight of simple Beijing hospitality and mouth-watering food.  As a bonus, they have a few parking spots belonging to the restaurant, and if you know SF, that is a gem...Superb food + Parking!  Love it."
"Just got delivery from Beijing the other night, it was good, and very fast. We ordered more 'american chinese' style food: Vegetarian hot-n-sour soup: okay, a little too peppery. My guess is the meaty variant would be better. Sauteed green beans (with soft tofu added): pretty good Chicken with broccoli: good - nothing out of the ordinary Brown rice: no complaints. Delivery was very fast. Overall, a good experience, not too greasy, would order from them again for sure."
"This place is ideal for our neighborhood chineses place.  Totally convenient location and they have parking. Food is really good.  We've had the asparagas with chicken, beef with green onions, potstickers, fried rice, chowmein, sweet and sour shrimp.  All are delicious.  The beef with green onions could nearly pass for shaking beef at my favorite vietnamese place. Now for the ambiance.  It is cute but a little crowded and very noisy.  We were there last night on a friday and the place was packed. People were waiting in line outside the door.  Still, our kids were able to kind of walk around the place when they got bored (and they didn't have won ton soup poured all over them) Service is pretty good and the food came fast.  We felt like they rushed us out a little bit though.  They started to clear the table and brought over used plates from another table and started to stack them in front of us.  That wasn't too cool.  I'd have given them four stars except for that. We've ordered delivery also, and they are super speedy."
"There are photographs of patrons all over the walls... one was Yao Ming. Cumin Lamb is really, well... ""cuminy"""
This place was Great! good customer service! i actually never noticed this restaurant before until my friend had brought me there for lunch!
"Not only do they deliver, but they deliver at lunch time!  So, we wanted a day of dim sum. Loved the meat pancake - a bit too oily, but loved it. However, the rest of the dim sum we ordered really disappointed.  We tried: West Lake Lamb dumplings, Three Flavor Dumplings, and Fennel Dumplings.  They all tasted about the same.  The filling was skimpy, and worse, the dough was really tough.  Again, too oily. We also had the House Special Pie which was just ok. We intend to try more things and hopefully that will mean a revised review and more stars.  Not to mention a new favorite restaurant. To close - they are nice as can be, and are savvy with your delivery, the assume you'll only have 20's - the change is in an envelope!  SMART!"
"Last time I came here I had their cumin lamb, beef noodle soup and green onion pancakes and this dough ball dish. The cumin lamb was okay, personally I prefer the one I make myself since I make it with better flavor thanks to a restaurant grade stove. The beef noodle soup was okay, but I guess I just prefer Taiwanese style beef noodle soup. Their green onion pancake was pretty good, nice and flakey but a bit on the expensive side. The dough balls were ehh, I didn't like them but maybe it's not my thing."
"Pretty good - not great.  The hot & sour soup needs more hot and sour, some sriracha and a little vinegar fixed it right up.  I did like how they loaded up the hot chilis in the mongolian beef, but I think the dish needed something else in it, maybe a rice noodle bed.  The mushu pork was good too, things weren't greasy and it seems like they really know what they're doing. I'm going to try this place again but some of the less typical dishes the other dishes yelpers are talking about here."
"I'd like to come back here and try the other dishes. Three dishes were ordered: fennel dumplings, cumin lamb, and this chili delights special sauce with pancakes. OMG. this chili delight thing was crazy. I don't think anyone on earth is capable of eating the dish. i took a total of 5 bites, and after each bite, at least 10 mins worth of sweating. I'm pretty sure I'll have indigestion and heartburn in a few minutes..."
"Incredibly underwhelmed.  Maybe I don't have an appreciation for Beijing food (I've been there twice but have never eaten any of these dishes), but I didn't like the food here at all despite a friend's raves about it. - Green Onion Pancake - tasty but a little greasy.  Uneven spreading of the green onion among the pancake - Flour Balls - too gummy and not flavorful enough - Hand pulled noodles - noodles were okay, but even with a fair amount of black bean sauce (which most people would say is too much) was dry and not very tasteful. - Claypot soup - okay.  Meat pieces very small. The only thing I really liked was dessert - some sort of hot, baked puff with red bean in it.  Delicious."
"After reading all the great reviews we decided to take the drive from Oakland all the way to try this place out.  While the food is great, it really wasn't worth the drive out there.  There are only 2 things that I liked... 1) they have the best potstickers I've ever had... and i've had a lot in my 31yrs of life lol  and 2)normally a lot of asian restaurants use so much oil in their cooking.  not this place.  the food was oil free, very very delicious.  Also the portion size for what you order is definitely not to be desired.  If you're not a local skip it.  And if you do decide to go don't listen to everyone and get the cummin beef.  it was beef with a whole bottle of cummin.  lol not that great.  :)"
"This restaurant has very delicious food.  Everything that I have tried, I have loved! I especially like the -Green onion pancake -Chicken mushu -Egg flower soup Great service, fresh food...love it!"
"It's been a few days since my husband and I ate dinner here as we continued on our quest to find the best noodle soup. I'm still salivating just thinking about the hand pulled noodles and three flavor dumplings that we voraciously consumed. The noodles were cooked perfectly, firm to the bite but not too hard, and the broth was seasoned well without an excess of oil floating around on top (which seems to be the case at most Chinese places). The dumplings were also some of the best I've ever had, and I have had a lot of dumplings in my life. They do not skimp on the portions here though so come hungry! Aside from the excellent food, the service is friendly, they speak English (a big plus in my book - I have been to far too many Chinese restaurants and ended up with something that was not what I had expected), and they have free parking. Thank you fellow yelpers for helping me find this great spot!"
"First of all, I love the food. Sans one star is for the wait they put me through. Now for the positives. Their take on the Mongolian beef is unusual and unlike other typical Cantonese restaurants. I was  shock at how little beef, in respect to the amount of onions, that was on the plate. But my wife said you're suppose to pair the beef with the onion in each bite and it sure was delicious I also like the sour vegetable pork noodle soup in claypot. Not sure if that's the name but sounds about right in mandarin. The house eggplant is also good with shrimp and hoisin sauce. Taste just as good if not better than Eric's on Church Street."
"Im surprise that I can get such authentic food in SF,Thank you guys~"
I must add the Vegetable Pie to my list of fav dishes!
This place is a breath of fresh air in a city dominated by Cantonese food. I look forward to… Read more » 
"It's Wednesday night, my wife, who is the toughest person I know, is on the couch crying due to a migraine headache.  I can't do anything for her which kills me!  Her stomach is upset, all the lights are off and I'm seating next to her trying to make her feel better.  She asks me to get her something light to eat like soup.  I suggest Won Ton Soup cuz there's plenty-O-Chinese food restaurants within blocks of our house.  She agrees saying it sounds good.  I call Beijing Restaurant because it's very close and has many and good reviews, takes credit cards and delivers however my wife can not eat shell fish!  When the gentleman answers the phone I ask if their Won Ton soup has shrimp in it.  It's not uncommon for the stuffing to contain shrimp.  The gentleman on the other end of the phone doesn't seem to understand what I am asking so he gets another person on the line.  I ask again and he says no, then I ask if he can deliver to which he replies no even though I know they do.  He gives me an excuse about it being busy and the delivery person is gone and won't be back for sometime. I explain that I am just around the corner but he still says no.  I decide that I can go get it and start to place an order.  He stops me in the middle of placing my order and asks me to call back in 10 minutes.  Needless to say, I didn't. In this day and age, customer service is paramount!  I gave Beijing Restaurant one star because I couldn't choose -1,000,000 stars.  Their food might be great but I'll never know because I will never eat there."
"You know that all great Chinese restaurant in the US must have either yellow or pink table cloth, or tacky strips of writing on the walls that tells only Chinese readers what to order, or painted with exquisite selection of exterior color of its establishment.  Beijing Restaurant has its staple off-red exterior with 70's sign that says 'Beijing Restaurant.'  I loved it.  The food here was very close to local food spots in Beijing, I was quite surprised.  The Zha Zhar Mien was especially good and the way it was supposed to be.  Don't skip out the Eggplant either."
"Northern Chinese style (Beijing/Tianjin area), my favorite place in SF. The waiters were super nice. Very casual dinning place. Apparently Yao Ming visited there and there is photo proof. Good for small get together. The space is very limited but food is delicious, which reminds me of hometown. The day I visited SF was so hot. No A/C available inside, kind of surprised but later figured out temperature that day was abnormal for Bay Area :)"
"I've been looking for a good chinese restaurant near my new home.  I got the lamb skewers (great), beef pancakes (like long flat pot stickers.  good but really greasy), and the beijing cold noodle (a little too sweet).  Not the best chinese food I've ever had.  They could ease up some on the oil, but overall it seemed fairly authentic and it will go on my list of places to hit up for easy to reach northern chinese food."
"The food is not bad. Had lamb with green beans, wanton soup, pot stickers, and fried prawns. Everything was pretty good, but the prawns were GROSS, they had the shells on and their faces. Oh we didn't like the Pot Stickers either Other than that it was good. They only accept cash for delivery."
"I kinda hate to do this to one of my neighborhood restaurants, but as a Yelper I feel compelled to give my two cents worth. First off I am not Chinese. I am a huge fan of the people of the Excelsior. And I try to support the neighborhood restaurants as much as my stomach can handle. Now I am writing this for my Non- Asian neighbors. If you like the food from Yummy House or Excelsior Chinese, than this is not the place for you. If you enjoy a spirited game of WHAT'S THAT ?, than head for Beijing Restaurant. This is one those places that if you are from the region, than you will like it. The food is either overly salted or bland and mushy. If you are not Chinese and you go to the restaurant, good luck. The staff is somewhat friendly, but the disdain does present itself when you begin to ask questions about the menu items. In all fairness, we did try this restaurant a few times and each experience was just as bad. Sometimes you just don't want your prawns looking back at you as you bite into it."
"Not your standard Americanized chinese food.  Granted they offer those dishes, but why in the world would you ever order them?  Beijing style is why you come here.  Ordered a good array for only two people- Cumin Lamb:  If you like cumin, this dish is wonderful.  Good quality meat, and the flavor is really good.  I have a very low threshold for spicy, and my friend love hot.  I thought it was too hot, he thought it was just right. Onion Pancake:  Really good.  It was unlike any onion/scallion pancake I have ever had.  This pancake was light and fluffy, with great flavor.  Nothing like the greasy, chewy, and skinny pancakes that are usually so disappointing.  Order this to gain a whole new respect for the onion pancake. Beijing Noodle with Special Sauce:  This was just ok.  The noodles themselves were good- homemade, chewy and just right.  However, I was not a big fan of the ""special sauce"".  I think it was plum something.  Eh. I'd pass on this...or try a different noodle dish. Spinach with Garlic:  Just as the name says.  Good, basic vegetable dish. I am definitely excited to go back and try all the things I missed.  Perfect restaurant when you are looking for great authentic chinese."
"Very authentic Beijing-style food! My wife and I ordered four items: 1) Beijing noodles with special sauce (Beijing zha jiang mian). I've had this in Beijing (where there are places that specialize in this one dish) and this is identical in style and pretty competitive in quality. As others have noted, the Beijing version of this is not quite the same flavor as Korean za zang noodles; the sauce is a bit saltier and has meat, and there are veggies to mix in as well. The noodles are freshly handmade and it's obvious from the texture. 2) Beijing vegetable pie (jiu cai su hezi). Paper-thin pancakes wrapped around a filling of green onions, tofu, and some other vegetables. Beware: this contains dried shrimp, so if you're allergic, best to avoid it. But if you're not, you'll appreciate the rich savory flavor and the fact that, although it's obviously fried, it doesn't come out at all oily. 3) Steam house special baozi (xiao long zheng bao). This was nothing too exceptional: it's a bun with a pork and vegetable meatball inside. They will warn you ahead of time not to expect a Shanghai-style xiao long bao (the kind with the paper-thin skin) -- this is a full-fledged bun. I may not sound super-enthusiastic but I'd probably order it again; it's a simple dish executed well. 4) Spicy bean curd beef (lazi xiang gan niu rou). If you've had Hunan xiao chao, this is similar, strips of bean curd and slices of beef stir-fried together. But it also has strips of crunchy bell pepper and other vegetables that provide a more varied mouth feel. Despite the name it's not particularly spicy. All in all, I'd definitely go back next time I was in that part of San Francisco with a hankering for Chinese food. Definitely reminds me of the food at the mom-and-pop places I like to frequent when I'm in China."
"Good Stuff. They aren't the cheapest I've had, but so what. The food is REALLY traditional. They are all the classics you would expect, just better. Check 'em out."
"""Cumin Lamb. Cumin Lamb. Cumin Lamb. Must go there now!"" This has been the latest soundtrack of my mind. I have been possessed by the powers of Beijing Restaurant and their mighty culinary skills. Wistful thoughts of that lamb, and it's cuminy goodness, have disrupted my ability to concentrate. My life will never be the same."
"Stopped by this place because it was convenient. I just needed something, anything to eat so I could… Read more » "
"The place has been fixed up very nicely inside and out since Beijing Restaurant took over, and the food and value are a definite step up from the many other Chinese restaurants in the Excelsior. They do lunch specials 11-3, which are much more mainstream chinese options that you see everywhere and just fairly average quality, but you get a whole meal (spring roll, rice, soup) with very generous portions for $5.50. For dinner or a la carte, the food is really fantastic. I am no expert on the different styles of Chinese cooking, but we've been trying out the menu and have definitely found some unique dishes. They also have a good number of vegetarian options, including a veggie mushu. And as others have said, the green onion pancakes are great!"
"I didn't think much of this restaurant because I would drive by this lonely red building in what looked like nowhere.  However, someone told me this place was great and it was also a favorite of Yao Ming. SOLD! Never mind the fact that I have never seen Yao Ming play. SOLD! hahaha. My favorites were the cumin lamb, five-spicy boiled beef and garlic spinach.  I couldn't stop cramming garlic spinach down my mouth.  I am a HUGE fan of vegetables and it tasted so frigging awesome we ordered a second plate. There was an order of chicken wings and fried tofu. Someone dubbed the fried tofu as Beijing french fries and was popular enough for another order. I'm biased because I like fried food in dosages so I dutifully ignored any more helpings.  I think the wide noodle salad was good, but once all the cilantro disappeared I stopped fishing through that plate. We ordered so much I didn't keep track of what we ate and I was full for three hours. The service was nice and the people were very accommodating since we had a lady with a baby! The little tyke stayed quiet and I was surrounded by good friends. I'll be coming back!"
"what the heck?  this place is really good!!!!  how did that happen?  i guess new owners took over at one point and man- they are doing something right.  cause this was some quality chinese food...for a pretty good price. the old man was sick, which he always is when it's a holiday or anytime i have vacation time scheduled, and he was craving hot and sour soup.  so we decided to try beijing.  then we realized yao ming ate there- and we were so pumped.  that pumpedness might have caused us to order a little more food than we needed- but we got 3 meals out of it for 30 bucks.  not bad. everyone said not to get the hot and sour soup- but we go against the grain and it was really tasty.  just enough spice and not to thick.  also had the beef pancakes which were wicked good with a little hot sauce on them.  potstickers were standard, if not a little on the large side.  chicken chow fun was ok- but i'm not a girl that likes big, flat noodles anyway,  and we got the beijing beef, which was nicely spiced and really tender.  no gross pieces of meat here! the decor is really neighborhoody with large pictures of patrons plastered on the wall with neon construction paper.  everyone was friendly and the takeout was packaged properly.  i think this might be our new go to chinese place in the neighborhood...if only to get our picture on the wall! and if it's good enough for yao ming...it's good enough for me."
"Great food. Yay for delivery & within an hour of placing the order on a friday evening. Green Onion Pancake - very nice. Better and less greasy compared to other places Stir Fy potato - yep, it looks like noodles, but its quite tasty. Quite garlic-y though. Could do with some salt. Green Beans - very nice. A bit greasy, but thats probably by definition Mu-Shu Chicken & Vegetable - Very nice. Liked it mucho Cumin Lamb : Had to order it based on the reviews. It was okay.  A bit chewy and as advertized full of cumin."
"There are pictures of diners on the walls of this cozy, house-like restaurant, including many pictures of Yao Ming.  I wonder where he sat when he dined there?  It's clean inside by Chinese restaurant standards.  The majority of diners weren't Chinese. The menu has your standard Chinese fare along with Beijing specials (warm pots, hot pots, dim sum, flour balls, and hand pulled noodles). The menu says they don't use MSG and that they have free delivery. * Stirred flour balls with three flavors ($7.25).  The flour balls are tiny little chewy balls stir fried in a slightly sweet, soy based sauce with shrimp, a mild white fish and chicken (three flavors), zucchini, and frozen peas and carrots.  The balls are very hard to pick up.  There wasn't much meat.  The dish was interesting but hard to eat - probably wouldn't get it again. * Beijing beef pancake ($7.25): A must, but you need to eat it quickly. The outside is thin and crispy and the inside is stuffed with juicy ground beef.  If you let it sit, the pancake becomes soggy. * West Lake lamb dumplings ($7.50): Very good boiled dumplings though not as good as Kingdom of Dumpling, juicy ground lamb in handmade thick wrappers. * Beef stew noodle soup:  The broth was too salty and not that beefy.  Good handpulled noodles though they're not as good as King of Noodle's. * Hot braised beef tendon ($8.95): Served over a bed of bok choy, the braised tendon pieces were extremely tender - really good, even better than I expected and I've had plenty of tendon * Chicken with ground bean sheet ($7.25): A bit oily but very tasty stir fry of slippery wide, clear bean noodles with pieces of skinless chicken and topped with cilantro Remember to get the beef pancake and hot braised beef tendon."
"It's called Beijing Restaurant on Alemany and Ocean and it's a rare find and an oasis in our neighborhood.  We've been twice in the last week and both times the food was wonderful and really interesting.  I should say my husband is Chinese and both of us are adventurous Asian food eaters, so we tend to know quality and authenticity when we find it. The owners Sandy and Jin are two Beijing natives (by way of New Zealand) who are young, energetic, and very outgoing.  They are very excited about their food and eager to tell you about the special ""small food"" dishes  and hand-made noodles Jin's mother (who ran a restaurant in Beijing for 20 years) is making in the back alongside another trained chef. The restaurant specializes in Beijing cuisine, only here, they mean it. The place is small (9 tables), occupying an unusual corner spot you may have never noticed before. There are dishes here you will rarely find in the bay area and everything we've had has been wonderful.  The first time, we had: * Cumin Lamb * House Special Pie--really a kind of turnover with wonderful pork and ginger * House Special Steamed Meatball--amazingly tender and delicious The second time we had: * Warm Pot with fish-a kind of soup in a clay pot with tender slices of rock cod and preserved vegetable in a tasty broth * Beijing Beef Pie--fantastic * Beijing Style Noodles with Special Sauce-made with hand-pulled noodles you mix everything together with cucumber, been sprouts, and celery--a tad salty, but that might be Beijing style * We even tried dumplings with fennel! Apparently it's a Beijing favorite The menu has lots of other interesting dishes on it, including flour ball dishes (meaning dishes with dumplings), and lots of Beijing specialties as well as many more traditional Chinese restaurant dishes.  They do a very inexpensive lunch as well. I hope Yelpers will check it out and help these guys get off the ground."
"I reserved my review until now mainly because I wanted to give this place another try and I really did want this place to be good.  We need good/clean restaurants in the area. My first visit was take out.  I ordered traditional Beijing dishes.  I don't remember what because it was some time ago.  I do remember that I was disappointed by the lack of taste and poor representation of Beijing food.  My second visit was dine-in.  I was hoping that it would be better than take out.  Again I was disappointed for the same reasons.  My girlfriend is a fan of fried crab wontons.  I know it's white people food, but she's white so that makes it okay.  It came out looking like egg rolls, all rolled up.  We have NEVER had crab wontons rolled up like egg rolls.  We also ordered the Special Flour Ball with vegetables.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw canned peas & carrots and something diced up (flour ball) with a bit disced cucumbers.  Where are the flour balls?  It was awful!  We also ordered the Hunan Fish.  Again it was awful.  Imagine watered down Hunan sauce from a jar over fired fish that had been in a take out box for 30 min.  Yes, soft and saugy.   For desert we ordered the Fried Sweet Cake Beijing Style.  OMG, it wasn't cake at all.  It was fried sweet bun (like pork buns) with red bean paste inside over a bed of raw cabbage.  Yes, cabbage!  Who uses raw cabbage as garnish on a desert?  To make the dish sweeter they sprinkled plain sugar all over.    Needless to say we will not be back despite the glowing reviews here. Why people think a restaurant is good because Yao Ming eat there.  Yao Ming is NOT a chief nor a food blogger/writer.  He plays basketball!"
"Opened less than a year, this small restaurant prides itself of several well prepared Beijing inspired dishes. Yao Ming dined at this place as well. His photos are well scattered throughout the wall. The food is delicious. My favorites are Jing Dong meat pancake, spicy boiled fish, mao xue wang spicy (blood and guts).  Don't miss their signature lamb dishes: lamb dumplings, cumin lamb. and warm pot of soup of lamb and preserved vegetables. The noodles are freshly hand-pulled at the site. Great value...no dish over $9.95, majority are around $6.95. Yummmy."
"We had an exceptional 12-course meal at Beijing (13 when you count the bonus plate after we paid the bill). It was a little bit of a cultural experience as we learned the stories behind the food. Not everyone in China eats rice, for instance. Away from the waterways, only the more affluent routinely eat rice. So the poor have to use something else. So they make flour balls as a substitute. Two of our dishes were from potatoes, too. I had no idea potatoes were that widely eaten in China. If you look at the photos I've posted you can see what we had in total. I'd say my favorites were the cumin lamb, which was spicy and perfectly cooked, the sour cabbage soup with clear noodles, the handmade noodle soup with beef, the flour balls and the stack of potatoes with black vinegar and chili sauce poured over it. The price was more than reasonable with the cost per person at about $27 each for our group of seven. The neighborhood is a little rough, but not too bad. I could see myself eating here many times as I explore the menu."
"Went by this bright red place all the time but never went in until now. Had the sweet and sour shrimp, onion pancakes, eggplant, and rice. First impression, not bad, not bad at all. My favorite would be the sweet and sour shrimp, flavorful, not that soft, not that crunchy. Onion pancakes were ok, not good or bad but fills you up very fast. Would come back here again to try there lamb dishes."
favorite items on the menu (now that the fiance and i are regulars): (*) steamed bao tzi (steamed pork buns) (*) fennel dumplings (*) green onion pancakes (*) lamb and sour cabbage claypot the owners are still as friendly and helpful as ever.
what an interesting evening. the fiance and i went back to kappa tonite for dinner. we sat near a… Read more » 
"One of the best Beijing places I've been to in San Francisco. I lived in Beijing for a while so I can say that their food is pretty authentic. Of course, you still have to watch out for the Cantonese and Americanized dishes. I like the lamb dishes including the skewers. The seafood clay pot is great and is relatively healthy. I like how there are pictures everywhere including one of Yao Ming who happened to visit the restaurant."
Great food.
"I'm usually not a big Chinese food girl, but there's something about this place that keeps me coming back. First, it's the great selection of soups and fresh vegetables. All the food is cooked perfectly every time. The owners, waiters are always nice, and you can tell they really care about the service they give to their customers. I think you can't ask for anything better. I now have my favorite restaurant in the excelsior. Sorry sushi raw, you're too expensive and ya just down hold down the same type of welcoming as Beijing Restaurant!:) YUM, anyone who hasn't gone here, go, get a soup with extra veggies, it's healthy if you don't want to go too greasy, also another great thing is, sweet and sour shrimp, it's the alternative to pork or chicken, much lighter. Another YUM is their eggplant dishes, their pot stickers rock, and the wrapps with the stufing and plum sauce. crap cant remember what it's called. Those are my top favs. go gettem!"
"How much do you trust celebrity opinions? That's right, someone who in reality you really don't know but are exposed to due to the lovely television.  As a result I'm usually skeptical at best.  I didn't put much faith in my friends who were touting this place with the assertion that ""Hey, Yao Ming eats here!  It's gotta be good!"".  After all, there are thousands of Chinese people in the City and I'm guessing many of them don't quite have the burdens of pro basketball to weigh them down in their production of great Chinese food. Well Yao, tip of the hat, well done, you are now famous in my book for your culinary sensibilities and not just your jump hook. To make this review short, this is the best Chinese food I've had in the City.  You know, like me and at least 2 of my dining partners were like ""we're gonna take our parents here next time they visit the City!"" good.  You won't find greasy meat and veggies served up in a kiddie pool of sauce.  You'll find awesome flavorful dishes with the right amount of everything.  The Cumin Beef is highly recommended as are the hunan green beans.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, I'd order off the beaten path for the best experience.  Just about anything off of the Beijing Special list is golden.  Ever had flour balls?  Me either until I came to this place.  Give them a try!  If you find yourself still lost, ask the waitstaff.  Our waiter recommended the cashew shrimp and we got a delicious lightly glazed serving of shrimp and vegetables that tasted ridiculously fresh and was a nice compliment to the spicy dishes we ordered. Another great part; the prices aren't too different from any other place in SF and the food is top notch. The only possible drawback is that they do close at 9pm so make sure you're in early."
"Yao Ming has 'endorsed' the place. He is Asian, a big one at that, so I trust his opinion. His face is plastered all over the walls along with a bunch of other locals who have gorged themselves on the delectables found at this joint. Good stuff."
"This was hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had in my life.  I am 28 years old and have eaten a lot of food in my life, and this was really good.  Very new flavors for me, very fresh food, very delicious.  I recommend going with a larger group so you can try a variety of dishes. We had the lamb, meatballs, a few meat pancakes, chive pancakes, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, a cucumber dish, a sour-ish onion/noodle/dumpling soup, a cold fat noodle dish, an eggplant dish, a greenbean dish, a crazy spiced sliced potato dish. Of all of those dishes I recommend the eggplant and the potatoes the most.  I'm sure there other dishes that were excellent too, and am excited to go back. The interior is modest, the staff is very friendly and congenial, the price is moderate (good value).  Parking is available behind the restaurant.  Credit cards are accepted.  Photos of happy customers on the wall, including Yao.  They deliver w/in a 2 mile radius."
"Beijing has just won a new convert. I started with the hot & sour cucumber. Not that hot and not that sour, but crisp and refreshing. The cumin lamb was tender, spicy in a slow heat way, flavorful and not at all oily. (Lamb is fatty, you can't help that, but the dish wasn't greasy.) I would order either dish again (after I got a chance to try some of the other dishes that you don't find on too many menus in Cantonese SF) (not hatin' on Cantonese, I love HK style, but I do like to have a change of pace) (as apparently do some Cantonese folks as I heard some sam yup at the next table). The staff was all friendly. The place is on the small side, nine 4-tops and a couple 2-tops. When I got there, the 2-tops were being used with the 4-tops to seat big families -- the one next to me was chowing down on some apparently authentic dishes such as a won ton soup with glass noodles. Despite me being a lone diner and there being another lone diner they sat me at a 4-top with no attitude and did not rush me either. (Of course, there was only one chair at my 4-top but still, they didn't ask us two lone diners to share a 4-top.) The place is definitely on the informal side -- they did borrow the other part of the table for less than a minute while switching out empty plates for full at the next table, but they asked if it was okay and I said it was. It wasn't a big deal for me but just be aware this place is close quarters. (Although the sound level is quite reasonable.) This place is definitely family-friendly. The big group had 2 young girls with them and there are photos of customers' families with the staff all over the wall. A few of the photos are with Yao Ming in the restaurant. I asked about it, and they said he had been there twice. Hey, if it's good enough for Yao it's good enough for me. I would definitely eat here again and I would bring friends here."
"Just moved in down the street from this place and have really lucked out!  The food is fantastic, the vibe inside is very relaxed and customer oriented with neon-backed photos on the walls, and a very friendly staff.  The one criticism I have to make, which almost took the review to 4 stars, is sometimes the staff can be a little slow and/or confused.  I have been here twice and both times we've had to do some extra waiting before getting service.  I've also seen other customers struggling with this as well, having to flag down a server to order.  I only really point this out because the place is so small that there shouldn't be tables that go forgotten; especially when the restaurant is only 3/4 full.  That being said, when they do get around to helping you it's fantastic, aside from the issue we had last time where our vegetables came out 10 or more minutes after our meat and noodles, again, another table was having the same problem. I haven't branched out to the Beijing style dishes that a lot of people on here have been talking about but now that I've read the reviews next time I know what I have to order!  Thus far the sweet and sour shrimp (sorry for being a cliche whitie) is out of this world!  A light sweet red sauce on perfectly fried big shrimp with pineapple, onions, and green peppers.  The asparagus chicken was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The chow mein extremely surprised me as it wasn't greasy AT ALL!  Packed full of flavor but not drenched in oil it was some of the best chinese noodles I have ever had.  The pot stickers were also good, but probably the least favorite of anything Ive had, but a killer deal!  $4.50 for 6 pot stickers is almost unheard of in the bay area, especially at the quality that they produce.  They were good, but I just prefer mine to be a little crispier with slightly thicker wrapper.  While we're talking about prices though - GODDAMN!!  SUCH fair prices!  One of the main things that will keep me coming back for more.  Pot stickers and 3 entrees for $27?  Yes!  Considering you get tea and water at no charge and that's what I usually go for in most situations, that's less than $35 out the door for an awesome and satisfying meal! I also want to note, and maybe this will further dampen my un-authentic food cred, that they have another delicious appetizer that is cream cheese and crab deep fried served with sweet and sour sauce.  Yes, it is americanized and unhealthy, BUT, it is amazing!  I haven't found a legitimate place that serves these (aside from panda express occasionally...meh) since I lived in another state, and I am extremely happy to have found a place that serves them worthy of my support :)"
"We had lunch here yesterday because my fellow Yelpers said this was a great spot.  Did I go to the right restaurant?  I can read English and I swear the reviews I read said it was good.  Are all reviewers friends with the owners?  Did you get paid to offer positive reviews? I told my mom, who also wanted to try it, that we did not enjoy the food and she said we might've gone on a bad day when the regular chef wasn't there.  I don't know ... We order the Beijing noodles aka Ja jang mien.  It was SUPER salty.  We didn't even mix in the all the sauce.  It was salty beyond belief.  So salty that we just couldn't stomach it. The second dish was the pork and leek dumplings.  That was bland and was just average.  Ling lings from Costco (although not quite the same thing since those are pot stickers) are even tastier. Our last dish was the beef pancake (not the meat pancake ...).  That was super oily and the beef filling was spread really thin but didn't make it to the outer edges of the pancake.  It also lacked flavor. Overall, I'm really surprised.  I love greasy food.  I love cheap food.  I love trying new restaurants.  I love being surprised by hole in the walls.  I love spending more money than I can afford at over rated places.  But what happened yesterday was just not good. Their service wasn't good either!  A young girl brought us tea and then came back with a plastic setting for our son (totally AWESOME!) but since we weren't ready to order, we asked her for another minute.  We're still waiting 5 minutes later when my husband finally flags a woman down.  The ""young"" person who brought our food over was not excited about working.  We were not difficult.  Never asked for anything except extra napkins and the check. From service to food, it was just a poor experience.  I'm really shocked.  I may disagree with some reviews but this was just crazy.  Authentic or not, it just wasn't a good meal.  Give it another try?  Only if someone else is flipping the bill ..."
"The food was delicious and love the presentation on the plate.  Everything was fresh and is made after ordering the food.  The restaurant could have been a larger environment such as, more tables and etc.  This is the Best Beijing food ever and is also located in Richmond, SF.  Compare to other restaurants I have been to was horrible.  As for now, I cannot think of the other Beijing restaurants, but at this place and location, this Beijing Restaurant is very delicious."
"So this is the place you always drive by and see, but never actually stop to eat at. Came on a Wednesday night @ 6, no reservation and 12 people. Small place, but we fit very comfortably along the back wall over 2 tables. As it got later, the place started to fill up with the neighborhood peeps. Solid: Chowmein - for the kiddies and they ate it all. Mongolian beef - good, but nothing out of this world. Standouts: Spicy chicken wings - loved these! My 2 year old ate them up, after I took off the outer spicy crunchy top - yay mom! Best part :) Beef Pancake - not what you'd expect. Very tasty and I really liked the texture and crispiness to the sides. Eggplant with spicy sauce - excellent and Sautéed String Beans - so, my bro never eats greens...and he scarfed these string beans down and commented how delicious they were over white rice. There is no better compliment than that. Skip: Salt n Pepper Pork. These were just pork nuggets deep fried with a cup of salt n pepper? Huh? I guess so you can watch your salt intake, but I did not care for it. Spent most of the after dinner chitchat time trying to see what everyone else in the place was ordering. Everything tasted super fresh and just good. I loved the little spicy ""kick"" every dish had. Very family friendly joint."
When I first moved into the excelsior I thought this place was the beesknees. My brother and I came in multiple times yet still the staff acted like they didn't know who we were. Not that I expect them to give us hugs and start dancing when we walk in but we certainly were not faceless customers. They always bring out the food out of order and that really bothers me. Also as another yelper said if you start questioning menu items they get all flustered. They all hang out and watch karaoke while you're trying to eat. The food isn't bad but the service has turned me off from this place.
"WOW, I have never tasted Chinese food like this.  I went because of seeing an article that this is Yao Ming's favorite San Francisco Chinese restaurant.  We went with our friend, born and raised in Hong Kong and she RAVED about the food as well.  It is unique, tastes I have never hadin any Chinese food."
"FRESH, TASTY, AND AUTHENTIC BEIJING CUISINE I ate at this restaurant for the first time yesterday, and was pleasantly suprised by how great it was.  It reminded me of the best restaurants in Beijing, minus the loud grimy bustle of China.  I will certainly be going back again. FOOD We ordered several dishes, almost all of which were amazing.  The green onion pancakes were chock-full of freshly chopped green onions and were hot and slightly crispy without being oily at all..  The cold wide noodle salad was very spicy but delicious, with a hint of black pepper.  We also had a clay pot with extremely fresh meat balls and homemade preserved vegetables.  The stir-fried flour balls had a firm, slightly chewy texture and were well seasoned without being overpowering.  The braised beef tendon was soft and chewy, with a rich brown sauce.  Only the black bean paste noodle (jia jiang mian) was not to my liking, as it was too salty.  We also ordered a dessert made from rice flour and red bean that was outstanding.  Although I am normally a fan of red bean paste, I found myself eating two pieces without even realizing it. All of the food was made to order and tasted extremely fresh.  The restaurant also uses seasons their dishes well, using minimal oil and salt and no MSG. SERVICE The restaurant is family owned and operated, and the staff is all extremely nice.  They chatted with us, made great recommendations about dishes to order, and did not rush us at all, even though the restaurant was pretty packed.  The food took a long time to come up, but the owner explained that this was because they were making everything to order.  We weren't in a hurry, and you could really taste the freshness! VALUE The dishes were well priced and the portions were very generous.  Especially considering the freshness and the wonderful flavors, this place is a great value."
"First, a couple of confessions. I'm a big fan of this restaurant and it's in my neighborhood, so I have a couple of reasons to rate them highly. Not saying they're perfect, just nearby and good. Observing other diners, I notice that they fall into two camps -those ordering Beijing-style food and those ordering typical Chinese-American fare - chicken chow mein, fried rice, and dishes in the style of other regions. I've never been to Beijing so I can only take the word of others that the rendition here is good. All I know is that I like it. I like the beef pancake and even the flour balls. My favorite is the noodle in brown paste and my son swears by their pork liver. I would not expect that their pseudo-Cantonese or Hunan dishes would be anything other than indifferent American food cooked Chinese style. If kung pow shrimp is your dish, perhaps you should seek it elsewhere."
"I come here with my boyfriend just about every 1-2 weeks.  They serve one of the best authentic chinese food in the city. Even Yao Ming thinks so...his pictures are all over the walls like he's the ambassador for the restaurant. Our favorites on the menu, are the cumin lamb and eggplant dishes. The seafood clay pot is good as well.  If your craving soup try their  half/half flavored hot pot- you can choose from different meats and vegetables, each of which are reasonably priced compared to an all-you- can-eat hot pot restaurant."
"ohhhh~~~i love the food there~~have been there tons of time and still wanna go~~~ as a originally beijinger, i have to say that~~u just cant find any other ""beijing"" food better than here~~"
not bad- local place that is good for take out and delivery
"As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, you should order their Beijing cuisine dishes rather than the Americanized Chinese fare.  The food is authentic, the portions are generous, and the price is very reasonable.  Dishes to order include: - Claypot soup with meatballs and pickled vegetables.  The meatballs are made from scratch and the vegetables are grown by the owners.  This is an exceptional (and very authentic) way to start a Beijing cuisine meal.  Just make sure you like white pepper because there's quite a bit of it and it makes your throat sear! - Beijing style gnocchi stir fried with meat.  This is equivalent to dough that's been chopped up into bits and stir fried with a meat of your choice.  Very tasty and a favorite among a lot of my friends who come here. - Zha jiang noodles.  Noodles are hand pulled so they're al dente and fresh.  Just make sure to use the sauce sparingly because it's quite concentrated and intense! - Beef pie or vegetable pie.  This is essentially a thin pie stuffed with your choice of filling.  Very tasty as well. Glad there's finally more (authentic) variety of Chinese food in the bay area and in SF in particular."
"The food is always fresh and delicious. The Mongolian Beef is addicting (i am somewhat of a carnivore). Their dessert is really good--red bean paste--also the vegetable flour ball plate is refreshing. I have yet to try the more authentic Beijing plates but hopefully that will change soon! Love the warm atmosphere that the family/owner provides; I love to see hardworking people, especially those who really love what they do and are damn good at it be successful. It is pretty busy for dinner but their lunch specials are great and not too busy: from 11-3pm which includes your entree choice, egg flower soup, and a delicious vegetarian egg roll and all for $5.50!"
I live in the area and had to find a new Chinese Restaurant. Emmys on Ocean Ave was just not cutting it. Thanks to YELP I can say I found it. The food was very tasty and fresh.
"My family and I went to this place last week, this place is small, but a lot of people. We waited around 15 minutes to got a table. The waiter was very nice. The food were very good! I gave 4 stars because this place wasn't so comfortable!"
"Was there the other night. Reserved a table for 10. The restaurant is kinda small, so make sure you make reservation if you have a big group. Not sure why they close at 9:00 pm every night, so be there early as well. The food is way better that what I expected for a small restaurant out of no where, and the price is great. Could not find a dish that costs more than $10, and they have their own parking in the city!!! For sure will go back and try the other dishes."
"I went here for lunch today with my sister and baby niece.  The food is good, but, more worth the praise, OMG, the service was phenomenally good.  One never expects Chinese restaurant food servers to be attentive or polite, so it was a huge surprise.  I think Chinese food isn't the healthiest, but the food here was definitely tasty.  My niece, who is the pickiest Cantonese little eater (non-eater is more like it), eats most of the dishes here, so we'll be coming back."
"good traditional mainland Chinese food with a little Northern flair. All of the traditional dishes that Americans usually order are pretty good, not greasy, etc. I suggest exploring the dishes that are not commonly ordered by Americans (including myself). My girlfriend has introduced me to their menu, and I think the authentic dishes here are superior to the Chow Mien or Kung Pao Shrimp, etc. dishes. Good choice, clean restaurant (in kitchen as well i've seen it) nice family owners, very funny and kind people."
"I am from Hong Kong, and this is one of the better hotpot places in the city I have had so far. I would consider it pricier for Asian food, around ~30 per head after all is said and done. They are known for their beef pankcakes, which I have to say are not bad. There non hotpot food is quite good as well."
"Great family-owned authentic Chinese food. Every time we go we try something new and are not disappointed. Although the place is kinda small, it's still a good place to go with a group and eat family style as Chinese food is meant to be enjoyed that way. The service is always prompt and attentive as well. You can tell they are working hard to establish this new restaurant as one of San Francisco's best places for authentic Chinese food. There's also a very convenient free parking lot. When approaching on Alemany from the south the lot will be on the right just before reaching the restaurant."
The food here is really good but do come with friends so you can try a wide variety of delicious items. Stay away from the stuff you will find everywhere else and stick with the Beijing specialties - you won't be sorry.
GREAT Food! Good Service! Nice Restaurant!
"The food is really great, home made, very fresh.  The service is charming-a little slow and inefficient, but in a way it adds to the charm. I really enjoyed the Beijing Noodles, but I admit they might not be for everyone."
"With all the positive reviews I was expecting to find a hidden gem....errr no, not really. Not having eaten everything on the menu, and not familiar with Beijing cuisine, take this review under those considerations. Hats off to the owners for even offering the eating public an option to the many different styles of Chinese cuisine. They are young and energetic and they will go far in this business. I mirrored my dish choices to what others here have recommended as signature dishes: Beijing noodles with special sauce Cumin Lamb House Vegetable Combo The lamb came first and it was notable that although this is a deep fried dish, there was an absence of oil pooling at the bottom of the dish. The lamb bits were just that: small irregular shards of lamb coated with spices and very unappealing. In fact it was salty. Forgettable. The house vegi plate was good: steamed with a opaque sauce that was flavorful. Not unique however tasty. The hand-pulled noodles came at last, and there is a little self-assembly process: vegetables are tossed in and the sauce is on the side with small bits of cured meat: pork?? It is dark soybean based. Not overpowering like a black bean sauce. It was...bland. I was sort of expecting something dynamic like a vietnamese garlic noodles, this dish fell way short of my expectations. At least they listened to the other reviews and it wasn't salty. On the positives: The prices were very good. The clientele looked to be locals. They have a parking lot! Service is friendly. If there is a next time..I'll try their dim sum."
"Wow!  I always thought this place was the type of Chinese restaurant like panda express.  Although it does offer the regular Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, combination fried rice, etc... , their specialty is the Beijing-style food!  Dishes I had are:  wide rice noodle salad (soo flavorful!  a little bit spicy!  delicious!), cumin lamb ( but then again, i love cumin with anything), Beijing beef pancake (basically a green onion pancake with beef in the middle.  i usually like my pancakes thin, but it's thick because of the meat so it's ok - very tasty), beef noodle soup ( the soup is very beefy/flavorful; the noodles were cooked just right - nice and chewy!  i wouldn't be surprised if they're homemade noodles!), lamb and pork dumplings (i like dumplings in general; these were good dumplings.  the lamb flavor wasn't very lamb-y), Beijing style meat ball ( i forgot what it's called on the menu; i think some people call it ""lion's head""; that piece of meat was soo soft and packed full of flavor!  i'm pretty sure there was a lot of fat in it! oh well!  it's worth it!), and for dessert, we had the Beijing style fried sweet cake! (i'm not a big fan of red bean, but this piece of cake was deeeeeeeeelicious! it's basically red bean paste wrapped in deep-fried mochi.  it comes out crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. )"
"came here recently with my friend helen y, her fiance and another couple. they'd been raving about it and we finally found the time to make it where we could all have dinner together! it's a little far, but worth the trip, especially if you like chinese food that's more dough-y and dumpling based. it's a good thing there were so many of us, cause then we were able to order so much and try everything!! as helen says, the steamed bao-tzi, green onion pancake and the lamb soup are all quite good. i actually don't even really like lamb, but the soup is quite tasty. the pickled cabbage goes really well together. and i also like the fat, clear noodles in the soup. we also got this chive pancake kind of thing, and it's not usually the way i eat it, but still pretty good. not the best, but still pretty good. we also got the dumplings there, that had pork, shrimp and cabbage in it, which was really tasty. we finished the meal with their beef noodle soup, which is also not the best i've ever had, but pretty good. although, it might also be cause i was SO stuffed that i really had no business to be eating anything else, but just couldn't resist. i love beef noodle soup, so i'm always glad when i find another place that has it, cause not everywhere does. i did like that they had a good ratio of tendon and beef, since i love both!! the place is family owned, and it might have been helpful since helen y and her fiance seem to be pretty cozy with the owners, but they seemed really friendly to everyone. it really has a family feel and they are very welcoming to all and just seem very happy to have you come eat at their place."
"Seen all the reviews and tried the place. I remember when it was nulite kitchen and before that it was fish and chips. Drove by at about 8, to try their wonton soup on a cold night but the restaurant was packed. So the following day ordered lunch special mongolian beef. Good taste and enough that i ate the rest for lunch. I like when the chiles are whole and you can break them up to your likin, very tasty. Second time i ordered the mushroom chicken, fresh mushrooms, no canned straw mushrooms here, very good. Now time to advance to eating in the restaurant. Not impressed. Order takeout, lunch special. Did like the chow fun, not so greasy"
I love the noodles here! They have amazing dishes and the quality of service is awesome. It is very quaint and I went here for my Christmas dinner. I don't recommend the Cumin Lamb for people who do not LOVE cumin or lamb (acquired taste I have not found).
"Bah humbug - I've been quite lazy in updating my reviews on places. Beijing restaurant is a neighborhood gem, especially in this area. Great food, great prices, but not the best Beijing food I've ever had. As far as Mandarin food, they don't have much competition (Old Mandarin, Five Happiness). If you want to ask me how I rank them, I would still say 1) Old Mandarin, 2) Beijing Restaurant, 3) Five Happiness. On this cold winters night, we ordered a hot & sour soup (someone had a cold), pork pancake, stir fried green beans, lion's head meatballs, and beef noodle soup. All together not expensive... - Hot & Sour Soup - Delicious - and hit the craving for something with heat. Great for a cold! Not too goopy, fresh ingredients (well maybe not the bamboo shoot, but when has hot & sour soup ever had fresh and not canned bamboo shoot?) - Pork Pancake - Delicious, but probably even better there. We had it to go, so it was a bit soggy by the time we got home. - Stir Fried green beans - Good, not as good as Mandarin Islamic, but good. Deep fried (as usual) and stir fried in soy sauce. - Lion's Head Meatball - Really good, but not worth the price. I think it was something around $9-10 for 4 meatballs. Sorry I'll make it myself next time for 1/3 of the price. - Beef Noodle Soup - Yummy noodles - yes they make them fresh - I'm not sure these were my favorite homemade noodles, but they were good - something about the texture that I didn't LOVE (I did like it though). Soup was a bit disappointing - overall great, but the one we had that night it was clear that the meat hadn't been stewed in the soup for an incredibly long time as the flavor was not drenched into the beef and the soup lacked some soy sauce flavor - it was a bit watered down. I'd definitely try it again to see if it improves, but initially quite disappointing. Yes, Old Mandarin's was better this time around. Of course there can always be round 2."
"Best Chinese in SF, particularly if you want to try some Northern variations.  I'd recommend the Beijing style noodles.  These noodles put the typical Lo Mein to shame.  The service is also fantastic.  The owners are from Beijing, so you have a better chance of having authentic Northern Chinese style food."
"wonderful little addition to our neighborhood. i never wanted to go into the other chinese restaurant that was there before, but my husband and i were impressed with how beautifully the new owners decorated the joint, so we went in. i am not a huge fan of ""authentic"" food - either mexican or chinese or japanese - but i felt the food was really delicious. not too expensive, though not cheap. i hope to go there for lunch sometime. check out the photos of the customers - and Yao Lin (the tall basketball player from China - forgot his name) standing with the owners - it's a hoot. apparently, he has come to visit the restaurant twice, which means they've got that authentic thing going on... I'd definitely give it another try."
"very good, had house special fish, 5 flavor beef."
"the staff is always friendly and the dishes are great, one of my new favorite restaurants!"
